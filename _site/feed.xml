      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/upholstery_change.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3198&quot; title=&quot;upholstery_change&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/upholstery_change.jpg&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Our 5-seater Italian Sofa Set needed help. The springs were broken and it was not possible for a person to sit on a seat without getting sunk in. So we decided to change its upholstery. After a week long research I thought of putting my notes down for those of you might be considering the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Choosing the Fabric :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;You have a choice of making your sofa look plain or printed. If you choose a printed fabric for the entire sofa it&amp;rsquo;s safer to select one from the designer catalogues. Otherwise, finally it could look like something totally different from what you had imagined. In line with the recent trend, there is also a mid-way approach of making your sofa partly printed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Prints and colors is a personal choice. However, its always advisable to choose dark colors if you have little children at home. Kids tend to drop food or wipe hands on the sofa leading to stains. Even dense patterns can help reduce the visiblity of a stain. In our case, we chose a dense pattern for the back rest and seating area and a light color to contrast the rest of the sofa. Such an arrangement also helps highlight the pattern used. Its like framing a painting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Also, its best to choose fabrics that are thick. They make the sofa last longer. Thinner fabrics yield easily to pressure over a period of time. Velvet fabrics attract more dust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Jute fabric has a great look and feel but is eventually very risky to use. If one fiber comes out from one side all other threads could yield.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Buying Raw Material :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;One thing is for sure, all materials present in hardware shops have great margins within mrp. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a good discount by picking it up yourself. I bought the foam sheets as well as the fabric from a Haryana Handloom shop. Good options in brands for foam sheets is &lt;i&gt;Kurl On&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rest well&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/types_of_foam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3201&quot; title=&quot;types_of_foam&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/types_of_foam.jpg&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Foam sheets, each of different thickness&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Raw material needed :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(foam sheets are all &lt;em&gt;Rest well&lt;/em&gt;, 40 density ones)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;5 foam sheets 4 inches thick, Rs 334 per pc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;3 foam sheets 1 inch thick, Rs 554 per pc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;4 foam sheets 15 mm thick, Rs 150 per pc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 roll of elastic tape,  Rs 480&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 ½ kgs of nails, Rs 180&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 litre of fevicol, Rs 105 per lt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 litres of special adhesive solution, Rs 120 per lt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 meters of jute fabric (looks like a gunny sack), Rs 30 per mt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6 meters of marking material (thin, white cloth), Rs 30 per mt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;12 wooden legs, Rs 60 per pc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;12 meters plain sofa fabric, Rs 120 per mt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 meters printed sofa fabric, Rs 480 per mt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost of Labour was Rs 750/- per seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;The toughest part was deciding how many meters of cloth we would actually need. I had to make 3 trips to the fabric shop due to the extreme amount of confusion. I guess its always better to buy the cloth and fix a carpenter from the same shop so there is no conflict in opinion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Changing the upholstery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/removing_old_fabric.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3199&quot; title=&quot;removing_old_fabric&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/removing_old_fabric.jpg&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Removing old fabric&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Good carpenters will manage to rip open the sofa in no time. You will soon be flooded with a 6-feet tall stack of dry waste. Save the big covers in which the foam sheets were bought. They will be helpful in managing the dry waste stacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/elastic_mesh_wok.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3200&quot; title=&quot;elastic_mesh_wok&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/elastic_mesh_wok.jpg&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Springs secured with elastic mesh work&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;Once the sofa is opened completely, the springs are held in place by a mesh of elastic tape that the workman knits skillfully through the sofa springs. Measurements are taken of the sofa and the cloth will be taken away for stitching, only to be brought back the next day. Paranoid or suspicious people can number the cloth pieces before sending. The next day he will have to show the stitched pieces with the numbering in place (else he has asked for more cloth than he needed).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/nailing_marking_cloth.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3202&quot; title=&quot;nailing_marking_cloth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/nailing_marking_cloth.jpg&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nailing of marking cloth&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;The next day, after fixing the foam sheet the cloth will be nailed to the sides of the sofa structure. Ensure that the nails are not spaced too far apart as the cloth could then come out easily between the gaps. Once the cloth is nailed you can sit on the sofa and check its comfort. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to use up left over cloth to dress the rest of the room. I have managed to make a runner on my TV table and a center piece on my coffee table. You can use your imagination to make table mats, table/music system covers, backdrops in photo frames, small tea coasters, etc. or like my husband you can suggest making a shirt out of the fabric and sitting on the same sofa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/11/final.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3203&quot; title=&quot;final&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/2012/11/final.jpg&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Use of spare cloth in accessories&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#262626;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:medium;&quot;&gt;A 5-seater sofa set will mostly take 3 days to complete. It&amp;rsquo;s always better to buy the raw material yourself and monitor the work while its getting done. That way you will not only get rid of unnecessary middle-men margins but will also be sure of the quality you will get eventually. Ready-made sofa sets look brilliant but often don&amp;rsquo;t stand the test of time. Behind the lustrous fabric some of them hide poor quality material and craftsmanship. However, a 3 day effort can create a sturdy sofa that is reasonable as well. Only drawback here is that you can not change the design of your original sofa. Suppose you want removable back cushions or seats it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to do that. You can only change the fabric and the inner material used to give your sofa new life. It&amp;rsquo;s like new wine in a newly painted bottle, but the bottle is still the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ganesh Pooja Year 2012</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/10/02/ganesh-pooja-year-2012/" />
    <updated>2012-10-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/10/02/Ganesh-Pooja-Year-2012</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/ganeshji_mantap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3151&quot; title=&quot;ganeshji_mantap&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/ganeshji_mantap.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ganeshji in mantap&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Ganeshji left our home for this year. It was special this time as I made the Ganesh idol myself. The &lt;em&gt;Think Green&lt;/em&gt; team in our apartment organized a 2-day workshop on idol making. They invited a person who is a graduate from a Japanese school in ceramic arts &amp;amp; pottery. I found the instructor very knowledgable and am glad I got to learn a few interesting techniques in clay modeling from him.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/handmade_ganeshji.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3152&quot; title=&quot;handmade_ganeshji&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/handmade_ganeshji.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Homemade idol&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make an idol :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select a mold based on the size of idol you want. We used a 12-inch 'plaster of paris' mold which is actually in two parts – one for the front structure of the idol and the other for the back.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dust both the molds using any talcum powder (it was cinthol in our case).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Massage thick, elongated chunks of clay. Press firmly over the mold. Ensure you do this quickly before the clay dries up. Remove any excess clay from the sides of the mold.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Press the two molds together and shake the complete mold gently to loosen the idol. De-mold the idol carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trim any excess clay using a fine pottery knife. Gently massage the clay with your fingers to remove any fine cracks. (it was an awkward moment for me, trimming Ganeshji's ears with a  knife :-()&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wipe the idol with a wet sponge to get an even texture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Now add the other features that were absent in the mold. For instance, we hand-molded the trunk, laddus and mouse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use toothpicks, pen caps and other fine instruments to mark features on the face and create patterns on the idol.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pick the idol up by holding it on both sides (left and right) and place it on a tray or any other place where it can rest for 24 hours. (lifting it by holding front and back can cause the idol to break)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Allow it to dry, preferably not directly under hot sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with the way the idol turned out. I remember my friends making fun of my mouse. To be precise someone said it looked like a cross between a frog and a lizard :-) Thanks to our instructor for skillfully correcting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/laddus.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3153&quot; title=&quot;laddus&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/laddus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; No-cook laddus&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Ganesh Chaturthi I made puliyogre, steamed modaks and laddus. Puliyogre is one dish I always make on this festival. Although I regularly make it at least once a week all year long, it tastes best on Ganesh Chaturthi. I think the vibration of cooking for God has something to do with it. The laddus I made were the no-cook ones. I ground fried gram dal with dry fruits such as almonds, cashew nuts and cardamom seeds. I then added raisins (fried in ghee) and powdered sugar. Finally I bound them with some hot milk. These laddus are easy to make and my kids love them too. Just call them &amp;ldquo;Chota Bheem laddus&amp;rdquo; and they will disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/temple_ganeshji1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3172&quot; title=&quot;temple_ganeshji&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/temple_ganeshji1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our temple Ganeshji&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pooja in the morning we had a few rounds of visits to the neighbors. This went on till evening. Finally, we caught the late night show of the movie &amp;lsquo;Barfi!&amp;rsquo; . I think this movie is one of its kind (in Bollywood at least). Very impressive to see how much they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to communicate with the lead actors having no dialogs at all. The person who has invested in this movie really believed in it. The movie is a runaway hit which goes on to prove that Indians still enjoy meaningful cinema. We don&amp;rsquo;t need skimpy skirts and weird thrusts for box-office hits. This movie will now open doors to other movies of the same genre. I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s India&amp;rsquo;s official entry to the Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/wte_book2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3158&quot; title=&quot;wte_book&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/wte_book2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;451&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The 'What to expect' series shipped from New York&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to a couple of other interesting things I received this week via mail. On Tuesday I got this courier sent to me my Dan Weissbrot, the relationship Director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whattoexpect.com/what-to-expect/landing-page.aspx&quot;&gt;What To Expect&lt;/a&gt;. The package contained their recent books they have launched as a part of the &amp;lsquo;What to expect&amp;rsquo; series. The famous book that every pregnant woman has used. I remember my dad buying this for my sister more than a decade ago when she was expecting her first child. The title of the book was “What to expect when you are expecting”. A wonderful week-by-week guide on what a pregnant lady can expect. Now there are books available for the first few years of development as well. I remember the courier lady&amp;rsquo;s expression when she handed over the parcel to me. She was draped in a saree sporting a cap, looking really tired. She said “Madam, what is in this package? I have been carrying it all morning and its quiet heavy”. I told her that the package contained books, shipped all the way from New York. She smiled as she shared my joy for a moment. Thanks to the &lt;strong&gt;What to Expect&lt;/strong&gt; team for sending these books to me. I found the books on the first two years of a child&amp;rsquo;s development as informative as the one on pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/mothers_world.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3159&quot; title=&quot;mothers_world&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/mothers_world.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;1018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My article in Mother's world magazine&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon I received another courier. This time it was the &lt;a title=&quot;Mother's world&quot; href=&quot;http://momandme.in/mothers-world.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother&amp;rsquo;s world &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;magazine and I was once again delighted. The September issue carries four of my recipes under a section called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;small-bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I had put together recipes and images of Mint Melon cooler, vegetable nutri-pie, chocolate pudding and green moong chaat. These were the evening treats for kids which are nutritious as well as tasty. The article turned out well, designed beautifully with vibrant pictures of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/title_page.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3171&quot; title=&quot;title_page&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/title_page.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a pretty lady with a kid by her side on the title page of the article. If you have never seen me before you might think its me. I pointed at the pretty model and told my husband “I don&amp;rsquo;t look like this” so my daughter pointed at the kid in the picture and said “&amp;hellip;and I dont look like this either” :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, so much for the week that went by. Ganesh Chathurti is the longest festival of the year for us. We actually worship the idol in our &lt;em&gt;mantap&lt;/em&gt; for approx. 10 days. On Sunday, we used a tank provided by our apartment for &lt;em&gt;Visarjan&lt;/em&gt; (immersion of idol in water). This time I am a bit more sad as I made the idol myself. We will miss you Ganeshji. We are sending you to water only to return quickly from the clay next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/10/card.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3169&quot; title=&quot;card&quot; src=&quot;/2012/10/card.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;323&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Card for Raina's class teacher&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I sign off, I just want to share one more picture with you. This is the pop-up card Raina and I made for her school teacher. As the card indicates, its for teacher&amp;rsquo;s day. I learnt it from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yce9McG50E&quot;&gt;simple video&lt;/a&gt; on you tube. You can try your hand at an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUGrIop_pwo&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;3-D pop-up card&lt;/a&gt; if you find the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited Ashtamudi about a week ago. It was the first time I saw the scenic backwaters of Kerala. I now know why it&amp;rsquo;s called God&amp;rsquo;s own country. The wide lakes lined with lush green coconut trees,  tiny fishes trying to escape the local fishermen,  birds perched on tree trunks singing the local melodies, all come together to create a memorable portrait of Ashtamudi.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We boarded a train from Bangalore at night 10 pm and reached Kollam station at 4pm the next day. That&amp;rsquo;s like 18 hours, well otherwise its 16 but our train got delayed. I slept through the journey so I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of it. One thing I do remember is that there was no pantry car in Kanyakumari express so we got no tea to drink till we got to the resort. Well, I can&amp;rsquo;t complain as I was hardly awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/boathouse.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3124&quot; title=&quot;boatHouse&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/boathouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Boat Houses at Ashtamudi&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/restaurant.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3125&quot; title=&quot;restaurant&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/restaurant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our Boat Restaurant&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Kollam station we drove 20 kms by taxi to the club Mahindra resort, Ashtamudi. A place totally worth the travel. We stayed in a boat house surrounded by water on three sides. It was a one-bedroom house, made entirely out of wooden planks. The best part was obviously the view from the balcony. As soon as I entered I was like &amp;lsquo;wooooaaahhh&amp;rsquo;. I gasped. There I was, in the middle of a huge wide lake! There was only water till where I could see. The silence was really eerie. I think living in big cities, in some way, makes us accustomed to background noises. Without them, the silence is awkward. There were different fishes swimming around in the lake. Some where big and silver, some were tiny with pointed noses. The lake was like a huge aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/fishermen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3122&quot; title=&quot;fishermen&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/fishermen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fishermen outside our window&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/fishnet.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3126&quot; title=&quot;fishNet&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/fishnet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bright bulbs used to attract fishes into net at night&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night we could see the bright bulbs (at the center of the poles) getting lowered towards the water. As soon as the fishes got attracted towards it the fishermen would pull the net up and trap them. There were about 4-5 such fishing nets installed near our boat house. Early morning we were able to see the net right outside our balcony. Jeez! good I didn&amp;rsquo;t trip over otherwise they would have finally got their big catch :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/earlymorning.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3127&quot; title=&quot;earlyMorning&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/earlymorning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The rising sun&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we went to a village close by. We just walked out of the resort with no where to go. In the forest we saw an auto rickshaw. We asked him if he will take us to the village. He agreed and took us to a &lt;em&gt;hot chips&lt;/em&gt; shop for some shopping. The banana chips from Kerala are famous. I picked up packs of banana, tapioca and jackfruit chips. After that, we had our dinner in a hotel. That place is called just &lt;em&gt;hotel&lt;/em&gt; as it&amp;rsquo;s the only one in the village. We returned home having enjoyed our little adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/diggingclay.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3120&quot; title=&quot;diggingClay&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/diggingclay.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Digging for clay from the lake bed&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3 was most exciting. We boarded a cruise boat and sailed away into the backwaters. It was an incredible moment to just speed into the water we had been enjoying from a distance so far. The scenes were breath taking. The greenery of the coconut trees, the local fishermen, the beautiful backwaters together created a painting I would call a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/denseforest.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3121&quot; title=&quot;denseForest&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/denseforest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Canoeing through the dense forest of coconut trees&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our motor boat brought us to a village after 30 minutes of sailing. We alighted and got into small canoes that took us to the interiors of Ashtamudi. After rowing for about 2 kms we got off near some small houses. That was the area where they make ropes out of coconut husks. An old lady gave us a demonstration of the same. The rope seemed really coarse and sturdy. I think I could hurt my hand if I tried spinning one, however her experienced hands created it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/caroverwater.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3141&quot; title=&quot;carOverWater&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/caroverwater.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cars, bikes and auto rickshaws being ferried easily&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned back to the steamer boat and made one last stop to drink some tender coconut water. We then checked out of Ashtamudi and as usual my daughter became depressed at the thought of a holiday coming to an end. We headed off to the station with blissful memories of a beautiful trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/janmashtmi.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3131&quot; title=&quot;Janmashtmi&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/janmashtmi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Janmashtmi celebration at home&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day we reached home it was Janmashtmi. We celebrated with daughters friends. We made a little &lt;em&gt;jhaanki&lt;/em&gt; (or set-up) to show the children how lord Shri Krishna was taken from Mathura to Brindavan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/cakemodel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3132&quot; title=&quot;cakeModel&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/cakemodel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cake model made out of segregated dry waste&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to share with you the model of a cake I made for the &lt;em&gt;wealth out of waste&lt;/em&gt; initiative at our apartment. For Independence day, we had an exhibition were we had to prepare a craft item out of waste materials. My blog finally has a picture of a cake that&amp;rsquo;s ineligible. Its made out of foam vegetable baskets, sketch pen caps, tea leaves foil and chocolate wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dishwasher one-o-one</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/08/03/dishwasher-one-o-one/" />
    <updated>2012-08-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/08/03/Dishwasher-one-o-one</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/dishwasher_loaded.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3060&quot; title=&quot;dishwasher_loaded&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/dishwasher_loaded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first thought of buying a dishwasher nearly a year ago. I was inspired when I saw my friend who stays in my building, using one. I remember the day, last year, when I went to her place to understand the value it could bring to life. I was confused about what I wanted. For those of you who might not know this, in India, it&amp;rsquo;s still very common to have a lady who comes in to wash the dishes. Dishwashers are not usually used. However, the culture is slowly shifting as maids are becoming hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using my Siemens dishwasher for a few weeks now and I feel that whatever I heard from my friends before purchasing it, is all correct. A big thanks to Venkatraj and Rajani, my neighbors who have patiently answered all my queries. They have been using a dishwasher for nearly 4 years now. This post includes information on usage of detergents, which I gained mostly from them. To make the decision a bit easier for those who might be considering buying a dishwasher, I have elaborated on the pros and cons of using one.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading / Unloading a Dishwasher :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to get the guy in your house who perfectly packs your suitcase when you take a vacation. He will be the best person to load your dishwasher. &lt;strong&gt;Aligning vessels could initially pose a challenge&lt;/strong&gt;. However, with practice you will start using those vessels which fit well in your machine and will slowly avoid using those which don&amp;rsquo;t. You will need about 10 minutes to load the dishwasher. This, initially could leave you tired if you were accustomed to piling dishes for the maid to sort out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unloading a dishwasher will leave you pleased. Simply because when your maid cleans vessels she probably leaves them hap hazard. There are cups over plates, over that big milk vessels and sometimes even spoons. That way when you need something you need to dig into a pile of vessels, clang them around and come out frustrated if you cant locate a small object like a fruit fork or a cooker whistle. However &lt;strong&gt;when you unload vessels from a dishwasher you will find them in order&lt;/strong&gt;. They get washed in the same place where you kept them so you dont need to hunt for anything. Its the same difference as placing clothes in a cupboard or in a pile on the laundry table. One place its organized and the other place it isn&amp;rsquo;t. So although you had to spend that extra 10 minutes while loading you save that same time while unloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to install a dishwasher :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A 15 Amp plug point (or different based on your machine)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Water inlet valve&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A sink hole for the water outlet pipe (same as your washing machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to first check if an area in your kitchen meets the plumbing requirements. The electrical point should most probably not be a problem as you can always use an extension box. As for the water outlet pipe, you can use the same outlet currently being  used for your wash basin pipe or your washing machine. Yeah, you might need to check if you have the space in your kitchen to fit a dishwasher and if there is a water inlet valve that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detergents and Usage :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a detergent like finish powder or some other local brand, you will need to rinse all vessels before loading. This is an activity that could possibly burden you. However, &lt;strong&gt;if you start using the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000080;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orders.ebay.in/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ImportHubViewItem&amp;amp;itemid=251054647724&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;finish power ball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; detergent you wont need to rinse anything&lt;/strong&gt;. You will just need to take the one-time effort of indenting it and then on for the entire year you can load your dishwasher with perfectly dirty vessels. That includes milk vessels, greasy &lt;em&gt;kadais&lt;/em&gt;, idli stands, etc. No rinsing, no pre-cleaning required. In fact, the manual that comes with finish powerball says in its instruction set that you dont need to rinse dishes before loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/quantum_powerball.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3077&quot; title=&quot;quantum_powerball&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/quantum_powerball.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not happy with finish powerball then try the quantum power ball which is expensive but more effective as well. If that also doesnt work, dude! What are you cooking, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Fill it, Shut it, Forget it :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/finish_products.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3076&quot; title=&quot;finish_products&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/finish_products.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have 3 units to load before running the dishwasher (besides the dishes, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Detergent box &lt;/strong&gt;: Here you put the detergent powder / tablet. In case you are running just half a load, approx 15 gms of detergent will be enough. For a full load you will need about 25 gms. The measurement marks will be present inside the detergent box so you know how many gms you have filled in. If you are using the quantum powerball tablet you just need to place it in the detergent box. The outer fine plastic cover of the tablet gets dissolved in hot water. The remains can be found in the garbage sieve. The regular powerball tablet has no such outer cover. The shiny foil in which it comes needs to be discarded before use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Rinse-aid&lt;/strong&gt; : You will need to fill in a rinse-aid liquid in the designated container which will be consumed slowly over a month or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Salt&lt;/strong&gt; : The dishwasher salt is different from the regular salt we use. You will need to fill about 1 – 1.5 kgs in the salt unit. For the very first run of the dishwasher, you will additionally need to fill the unit with water. From second time onwards, just salt is good. These instructions were provided with the Siemen&amp;rsquo;s dishwasher. Please check specifics with your dealer, based on your brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rinse-aid liquid and salt can be loaded and used over a period of time. When exhausted, an indicator will glow on the display board. The detergent however, has to be loaded for every run of the dishwasher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems that might crop up on using a dishwasher :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. One cycle not enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cook yourself or cook only once a day and re-use the food at night then a single run of the dishwasher will suffice. However, if you have a cook who generously uses vessels or yourself cook a variety of food twice a day, you could find the need to run the dishwasher twice. The time spent in washing could bother you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workaround :&lt;/em&gt; You can wash the greasy utensils like milk vessels, &lt;em&gt;kadais&lt;/em&gt;, etc; in the automatic dishwashing mode. On the other hand, wash glasses, teacups, plates, spoons and other non-greasy utensils in the quick wash mode. That way you save on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Less space for big vessels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dishwashers are primarily designed for a western lifestyle. Abroad, they don&amp;rsquo;t use as many pressure cookers as us. They don&amp;rsquo;t boil milk twice a day either. Hence, big vessels are more in our case and the dishwasher design might not be perfect to fit them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workaround : &lt;/em&gt;Select a dishwasher model that has collapsible blades. These blades are the ones that are used to hold plates. When you run short of space you can put the blades down and place big vessels over it (my plate blades are always down). Next, you can place some vessels over the non-collapsible blades as well. As a last resort, you might have to wash one or two big vessels yourself. Choose the ones that are non-greasy and easy to wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Sensitive skin to caustic soda in soaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find yourself washing a few dishes despite having a dishwasher. If, like me, your hands can&amp;rsquo;t tolerate caustic soda in soaps you might end up with dry, rough hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workaround &lt;/em&gt;: You can try using a mild, homemade soap. Rajani suggests boiling soap nut or &lt;em&gt;reetha&lt;/em&gt; in water for about 20 minutes to create a liquid soap solution. This can be stored upto a week and used for dishes that you need to wash on your own. It wont create any unwanted effect on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/08/dishwand.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3075&quot; title=&quot;dishwand&quot; src=&quot;/2012/08/dishwand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Soap dispensing Dish wand&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to solve this problem is to use a dish wand. It has a tube-like body which can store liquid soap and a head made of scrub pad. A bubble-like button is also present which you can press in order to dispense the required amount of soap. Using this dishwand can prevent direct skin contact with soap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Certain vessels not permitted &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain vessels need to be avoided in a dishwasher. For instance wooden spoons/ rolling pins, low-grade plastic, aluminum cookers/ woks, copper-bottom vessels should be left out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workaround&lt;/em&gt; : Replace your aluminum pressure cookers with stainless steel ones. Avoid using low-grade plastic boxes (its not good for health anyway). Use tupperware or any other dishwasher-safe plastic boxes instead, so they will not melt when washed with hot water. Copper-bottom vessels tend to lose their copper shine present below. I am ok with it so I continue to wash them as they are. Low-grade aluminum &lt;em&gt;kadais &lt;/em&gt; (woks) and certain other non-stick pans could also lose their shine or get stained. You will need to replace them with quality cookware which says that its dishwasher friendly. Always look for the mark below the dish before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Increased electricity expenses &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single run of the automatic mode (meant for greasy dishes washed at around 60 deg C) will take about 2 h 15 m. In this time it uses up 3-4 Kwh of power in the energy-saving models of dishwashers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workaround &lt;/em&gt;: You have the option of running a quick wash which washes in 1h 15m. Dishes come out fairly clean even in this mode. I was quite satisfied with the result. May be going forward, I will start using the speed wash as a regular wash cycle. This mode will take up as little as 1.5 Kwh of power, so you can even run the machine twice, if you like. Some models have the option of &lt;em&gt;half-load&lt;/em&gt; where only one tray of utensils are washed. This option is also great if your second load is less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you face a power cut during the running of the dishwasher, it will resume from where it left off, once power returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What I like most about the dishwasher :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have emotions. When presented with the challenge of washing a double load, it will not reply impudently or pull a long face.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When you return from a trip you will find it where you left it. It will not join your neighbor's house for a few dollars more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It will work in the exact same way, whether you monitor it or not. You will not catch it cutting corners.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It doesn't negotiate with you from time-to-time. There is no &lt;em&gt;running&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; based on which its performance depends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You will need to wash dishes yourself when your machine goes for servicing once in a way. You will not face system failure every other day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; This dishwasher is dedicated to my maids, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;   without whom I could do very well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dishwasher Delight</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/07/18/dishwasher-delight/" />
    <updated>2012-07-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/07/18/Dishwasher-Delight</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/07/dishwasher.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone  wp-image-3006&quot; title=&quot;dishwasher&quot; src=&quot;/2012/07/dishwasher.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;347&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently installed a Siemen&amp;rsquo;s dishwasher and I am all high on its presence in my house. I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to get one for a long time now but was apprehensive because of the dozen things one hears about it. In India, dish washing is primarily done by ladies who come in to clean the house, usually called maids. I think &amp;lsquo;maid&amp;rsquo; is one topic which causes a burst of emotions in every lady I know. Most of us at some point of time have felt jilted, cheated, hurt, etc. due to some maid. Just like in olden days they would say that you need great luck to find a good spouse, in today&amp;rsquo;s world you need to be very lucky to find a good maid (if at all there is someone like that). That&amp;rsquo;s why we can change the saying to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;maid&lt;/strong&gt; for each other&amp;rdquo;.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You remember that day when you had guests over and she never showed up? Or that day when you had to go out somewhere and she came in late? What about all those days when she took off on a festival, leaving you with the festive preparations and the house cleaning to do? Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started with my stories. I have waited for days at a stretch with that longing look in my eyes, for maids to show up. They havent. Sometimes they took off for as many as 5 days without prior notice. They always had a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gained a new degree of freedom today. I have liberated myself from an important job they do. A dishwasher will help me keep the dishes clean, leaving me with only the floor sweeping to be done whenever the maid bunks. Today was one such day. There was a pile of dirty utensils. The maid called in to say she can&amp;rsquo;t come and I was delighted. I was anyway going to try out the new dishwasher for the first time today. I loaded the rinse-aid liquid, detergent and salt. I said a prayer and started the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour or so later I was unsure of what was going on. After all it was the first time I had loaded the machine, that too all by myself. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know how to arrange the dishes. I saw the display. It said &amp;lsquo;0 secs&amp;rsquo;. I nervously opened the door of the machine and a cloud of hot air was released on my face. Along with dishes it cleans your face too :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to see the sterilized utensils. They were crystal clear and I was excited at the very thought of eating in warm, clean plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all those of you who are wondering if a dishwasher is a good deal, whether the effort in loading/unloading is too much, does it actually work on greasy Indian &lt;em&gt;Kadais&lt;/em&gt;? stay tuned for my next post on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I'm guest hosting Black &amp;amp; White Wednesday (BWW) for week #42. This event has been around for a long time now and everyone has been enthusiastically participating in it with their culinary B&amp;amp;W photographs. I personally love B&amp;amp;W pictures. Their ability to highlight subjects helps convey the essence of a shot better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Whenever I get a chance I like to observe pictures that were shot during the times of our grandparents. The simple B&amp;amp;W pictures speak volumes of the times back then. I am truly happy to be guest hosting B&amp;amp;W Wednesday Week #42. Looking forward to your participation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>When luck doesn't dip</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/07/01/when-luck-doesnt-dip/" />
    <updated>2012-07-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/07/01/When-luck-doesn-t-dip</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/07/lucky_dip.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2884&quot; title=&quot;lucky_dip&quot; src=&quot;/2012/07/lucky_dip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EK Supermarket is a place close to my house. I visit it every Sunday evening to get the week&amp;rsquo;s groceries. The management of the store changed in April 2012. In these last 3 months the new management tried to do a promotion by organizing this lucky dip event. I remember joking about the event the last couple of times I went there. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a lucky dip coupon mean to anyone? Usually, to me it feels like something that is supposed to happen sometime and will most probably have no effect on anyone in the vicinity. May be thats why yesterday, 30th June 9 pm I was busy eating dinner at a restaurant in Jayanagar not knowing what was going to happen soon. It was after dinner sometime when we were buying pastries at cakewala when we got a call from EK Super market. That was around the time when I was trying to convince my 5-year old to buy a white forest over a strawberry pastry. The guy on the phone sounded really enthusiastic. He said that I have won the lucky dip and I should come immediately to collect my prize which is a gold coin. I thought it was a prank. Like someone is going to call me at 9.30 in the night and give me a gold coin! I thought someone just saw me filling the coupon out and decided to play a prank on me. I told them that its too late and that I can not come until the next day morning as I was shopping in Jayanagar. Having said that, I happily continued with my pastry watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes I got a second call. The guy said that there were many people waiting for me. They had hired a photographer for the occasion and wanted me to reach there ASAP. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spoil the fun and I changed my mind. We dropped the pastries and quickly headed for the store. Just before we reached, we got a third call from the store. I told him I was nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got off the car I saw a crowd. I told them my name and they started clapping. That made my baby so happy. I actually couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what was happening. Soon they asked for verification. They called the number that was registered on the coupon and our phone rang. They took us to the office were we had some juice and cookies. They handed over the coin to me and took a few pictures. Thats when it sunk in that I had really won something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience. I have never really won a lucky dip. I actually don&amp;rsquo;t even believe in them as some of them seem rigged. This was the first time I saw such an event being conducted with utmost honesty. They had called the ACP of Banashankari to draw the lucky dip. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet him as he had left by the time I got there. The shop staff had created a nice atmosphere. I can still see their beaming smiles and their energy bouncing off the walls. Thanks EK Supermarket for a very memorable evening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The famous Mavalli Rooms</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/06/29/the-famous-mavalli-rooms/" />
    <updated>2012-06-29T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/06/29/The-famous-Mavalli-Rooms</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/06/mtr_3_scaled1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2865 &quot; title=&quot;MTR outside&quot; src=&quot;/2012/06/mtr_3_scaled1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; MTR,  Bangalore's Culinary heritage&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a glimpse of the famous Mavalli Tiffin Rooms located in Bangalore. They are known world-wide by the name of MTR. I think MTR is the one brand that everybody relates to when it comes to South Indian cuisine. Though its touched heights in the restaurant popularity chart and has also reached international markets with its instant mixes, MTR still continues to wear a simple, humble look that it had decades ago. I have not seen anything really change in the infrastructure of the restaurant since I was a little kid. Even the elderly gentleman who shouts out our name when its our turn, looks exactly the same. He still sits on a wooden stool guarding the entrance to the family hall.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for all of you who are wondering why the entrance is guarded and why we need loud announcements, I will explain to you how the restaurant works :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) You enter MTR and climb up to the first floor if you are interested in sitting with your family in something called the &lt;em&gt;family hall&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Here, you will find an old man in a white &lt;em&gt;lungi&lt;/em&gt; and completely matching hair, who will note down your name on a white sheet of paper that is supported by an exam board. God knows I wanted to take a picture of him but his voice was so loud that I was scared to offend him in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) You will now have to wait for minimum one hour. You will find people impatiently pacing around, crowding near the entrance searching for the number of people lined up before them. You will struggle if you can&amp;rsquo;t read Kannada in order to know how you are ranked in the list of people waiting. You will be seated on a wooden bench. You will mostly spend your time gazing at people who are sitting inside and eating leisurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Finally when you are just about to leave because you can&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore, your name is announced!. You feel an excitement like never before and you rush into the family hall to grab a seat for yourself and your dear ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) You could be sitting with strangers at a table. You will not be given a private table. That&amp;rsquo;s why its called family hall - all in the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Now comes the interesting part. You are told exactly what you can eat. You don&amp;rsquo;t get to select from a menu or anything. For example, we were told &amp;ldquo;You can have either dosa or upma&amp;rdquo;. When we asked for what else is there, he said &amp;ldquo;Upma and dosa&amp;rdquo;. I smiled like calling it in reverse order changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) The service is quick. We were given upma almost instantly. Soon after dosa appeared  with tiny little cups containing butter. The quality of the food is usually excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) You are given coffee and the bill soon after. Time to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Best part : the food&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tough part : the wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is in someway leading to the tough part. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when a modest restaurant turns into a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

I have always been a great fan of B&amp;amp;W pictures as they have fewer distractions and seem to capture the essence of a shot better. Thanks for hosting this interesting event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Baby's Favorite Food - Round up!</title>
    <link href="http://romasharma.com/2012/06/16/my-babys-favorite-food-round-up/" />

    <id>http://romasharma.com/2012/06/16/My-Baby-s-Favorite-Food-Round-up</id>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2012/06/event_collage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2801&quot; title=&quot;event collage&quot; src=&quot;/2012/06/event_collage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;event collage&quot; width=&quot;529&quot; height=&quot;484&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baby Food has always been a confusing subject. Specially since our traditional food is at times so different from what is medically recommended. Moreover, each baby is different and none of them are able to talk about what they really want. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes this topic a challenging one. Mothers have to just observe their babies while they eat and figure out a way to make nutritious food which is also eaten eventually.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I announced the event &lt;a href=&quot;http://romasharma.com/2012/05/16/my-babys-favourite-food-an-event/&quot;&gt;My Baby&amp;rsquo;s Favourite Food&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to know from moms what their kids liked as babies. I am really happy to have received these recipes from blogger friends. I want to thank you all for taking out your time and sharing your recipes with us. I am sure they will provide ideas to moms of li&amp;rsquo;l babies who might be having a hard time feeding food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the giveaway, my eBook &lt;a title=&quot;60 Great recipes for your baby&quot; href=&quot;http://babyfoodrecipes.in/&quot;&gt;60 Great Recipes for your baby&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced for 3 lucky winners. Well, it turns out I could not choose 3 people as all the recipes were so good. I will hence be giving a copy of my book to all the participants. You will soon receive a mail with a link to the eBook which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Great-Recipes-your-Baby-ebook/dp/B007QVHWDO/&quot;&gt;currently being sold on amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Hope its useful to you and other moms in your circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than the kids, this dish is dedicated to the mothers&amp;hellip;.it is simple, easy &amp;amp; won&amp;rsquo;t take much of your time. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This is a one pot meal for babies and toddlers and can be prepared as per their likes and dislikes. This is also a very nutritious rice with all veggies, rice and dhal in one pot. Kids, they ask for variety. So this is the dish which will make them happy and also make us satisfied. It will also look colorful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

My kids generally love dosa, adding cheese to the regular dosa's makes them to eat faster and quicker . This is their all time favorite foodright from age 1 .

&lt;div&gt;My little toddler loves to eat this particular Macaroni dish. She is very picky with her food I try my level best to convince her to indulge somefood. As she is learning ABCD I picked up this alphabetical macaroni from the store and introduced it to her and the end results were amazing she loved it and wanted to eat more. I have added some veggies and chicken to it. Vegetarians can minus the chicken.&lt;/div&gt;

Plain Upma---loved and liked by my baby arnav since 1 and 1/2 years old..I share special memories with this...so even though too simple and common...nothing as such special in dish...I deceided to send it to this event...also lovely theme...which revoked my sweet memories...Thanks dear Roma for this....I just tried this recipe on my baby who simply swallows things till now without chewing...upma can be easily swallowed so I think he loves it...Once while I was eating upma...I gave him small bite from my dish and to the surprise he enjoyed it ...so decided to make one for him by altering few ingredients...

&lt;div&gt;Pongal | Ven Pongal is a rice dish which is made in south india which is prepared with rice and moong dal. Usually this dish can be prepared for breakfast or evening dinners. My elder daughter's favorite dish in the evenings when she was a baby (almost from 1 year she started liking it). I used to make this dish with less pepper and green chilies and more ghee especially for my daughter.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Soy chunks cooked in a onion-tomato gravy with potatoes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kalyaniplatter.blogspot.in/2012/06/vermicelli-kheer-semiya-payasam.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2778 &quot; title=&quot;vermicelli kheer&quot; src=&quot;/2012/06/vermicelli-kheer.jpg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;vermicelli kheer&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Vermicelli cheer by Kalyani&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Vermicelli Kheer/ Semiya Payasam is yummy, healthy and also delicious payasam which is especially prepared during festivals. Payasam is simple to make and it usually decreases heat in our body when we have fevers and colds (especially good for children).
This payasam is my daughter's favorite sweet from her childhood. Also my favorite when i was in my childhood.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;--------------------&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indianbabyfood.wordpress.com/2012/06/06/pudina-pulao/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2796  &quot; title=&quot;pudina_pulao&quot; src=&quot;/2012/06/pudina_pulao.jpg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;pudina_pulao&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pudina Pulao by Roma&lt;/div&gt;

My baby doesn't eat rice very easily. She either wants to have it with dal or just plain. I found pudina rice as a nutritive alternative as it contains a chutney-like paste in which the rice is simmered. I am happy that the baby likes it too.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
