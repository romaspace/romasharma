<p style="text-align:left;">I love clicking snaps of things that I want to keep in my memory forever. Like John Keats said 'A thing of beauty is a joy forever'!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I remember seeing these saplings in the garden of my apartment complex and wondering what they were. Within a few weeks the plant developed indentations clearly indicating that it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat">Wheat</a>, most probably planted by accident. Guess someone might have thrown a little bit of whole wheat and the plant picked up.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Every evening when I went down to the garden I thought I must take a picture of the plant as it was growing up fast. One day I took a camera along and caught the wheat plant swaying in the breeze, basking under the summer sun. I find this picture particularly soothing. It kind of reminds you that a happy mind breezes through life effortlessly.</p>
