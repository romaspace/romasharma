<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Paneer Fusion in Garlic Sauce</strong></span>

<a href="http://excogito.wordpress.com/">My husband</a> is totally into North Indian cuisine and I love to order Chinese whenever we go out. One Sunday, I decided to make something that will make both of us happy. I had paneer, which everyone at home loves and I knew how to go about making koftas out of it. I wondered how those yummy paneer dumplings would taste in a spicy hot garlic sauce. Garlic, as we know takes over the taste of any dish it enters. Thats one reason we really need to think before adding it to anything.

Well, there wasn't much to lose so I got started on my paneer koftas and chopped out a whole lot of garlic. I didnt want to make the gravy too heavy so I decided to keep cream out of it. The end result was enjoyed by both of us. So thats how <em>Paneer Fusion in hot garlic sauce</em> came to being. I guess in Chinese cuisine they must be making a <a href="http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/ubbs/archive/VEGETARIAN/Tofu_Pan-Fried_Tofu_with_Garlic_Sauce.html">similar dish</a>, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu">Tofu </a>probably.

For centuries people have known the <a href="http://www.amazingherbs.com/meduseofgari.html">medicinal properties of Garlic</a>. In Egypt, Garlic has been found in the tombs of ancient Pharaohs dating back to 3,200 B.C. It was used by the pyramid builders who believed that garlic gave them strength. The only slave revolt in Egypt was by laborers over lack of Garlic, one year when the Nile flooded the Garlic fields. The Greeks used garlic to bring strength to their athletes at the Olympic game. So finally we all know the secret to winning an Olympic Gold!

This is my entry to <a href="http://www.nandyala.org/mahanandi/jihv-for-ingredients-jfi/">JFI</a> - Garlic for the month of March, 2008. Thanks <a href="http://mathy.kandasamy.net/virundhu/archives/2008/03/07/jihva_for_ingredients-garlic/">Mathy </a>for chosing such a wonderful ingredient which not only has flavor but also medicinal properties.

</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Variation</strong></span>
<ol>
	<li>If you are calorie conscious and don't want to deep fry the paneer balls you can microwave them for 3-4 minutes and add them directly to the sauce.</li>
	<li>You can used red chillie flakes instead of black pepper corns in this dish to give the gravy more fire and color.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Don't microwave the paneer balls for more than a few minutes as they will turn hard.</li>
	<li>Don't boil the dish much after adding cornflour paste as the gravy will thicken and you will continuously need to add more water.</li>
</ol>
