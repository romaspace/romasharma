My baby doll is nearly a year old. She shows off two tiny teeth every time she laughs. I cant seem to get enough of it. Although its really cute to look at I know her gums itch quite a bit. No wonder she is always putting things in her mouth. So I thought its time I tried my hand at some teething biscuits. Now she has something home-made to sooth her gums. I was happy with the firmness of these biscuits but like any other teething biscuits they have a potential choking hazard. You need to constantly monitor the baby while eating so he doesnt bite off too big a piece (He heee... now I sound like a baby product company :-))<!--more-->

Yesterday we got the baby's head tonsured at a temple in Bangalore. What a sad sight it was. She was too sleepy and got really cranky when we tried to hold her hands and legs firmly. She cried her head off and by the end of the ritual I was feeling dizzy. That brings us to the end of the series of events- her naming ceremony, annaprashan (giving food for the first time), ear piercing and head tonsuring. Of these, I really like the first two but the ear piercing and head shaving is not for the faint hearted. Now the baby's first year is almost complete. Phew! What a year it has been. We are now looking forward to her birthday. Its just round the corner. Here is to many more....

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>

2 tablespoons Roasted rice powder

3 tablespoons Roasted wheat flour

4 tablespoons cold apple juice

1 teaspoon ghee

<strong>Procedure :</strong>

<strong>To make roasted rice powder:</strong>

Roast a cup of rice for 15 minutes on medium flame, stirring constantly.

Let this cool down and grind it in a mixer grinder. Use 2 tablespoons of this powder to make the biscuits and store the rest in an air tight container.

<strong>To make roasted wheat flour powder:</strong>

Roast 3 tablespoons of whole wheat flour (aata) in a thick bottom pan at medium flame stirring constantly.

In about 15 minutes you will get the aroma of roasted wheat. You can turn off the heat at this point.

<strong>To make the teething biscuits :</strong>

Mix the rice powder and whole wheat flour with the ghee.

Now knead the flour with cold apple juice till you get a soft dough. Add more juice if necessary.

Dust the dough with wheat flour and roll into a flat layer 1/4 inch thick, with the help of a rolling pin.

Cut out finger length pieces from this dough.

Place these biscuits on a butter paper and bake in a preheated oven at 175 Deg C for 25-30 minutes.

</strong>

<strong>POTENTIAL CHOKING HAZARD :</strong> Please monitor the baby while he is chewing on these biscuits as he might bite off too big a piece that could cause choking.
