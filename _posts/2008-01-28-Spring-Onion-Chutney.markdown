<u><b> Spring Onion Chutney</b></u>

This chutney is very unique in taste as compared to its other <i>Green Chutney</i> counterparts. Spring onions are not as pungent as the regular onions. Besides being very nutritive in the raw form, they also taste better than when cooked in any form. Thats why, whenever I have fresh spring onions at home the first choice is a chutney.

<b>Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
	<li>7-8 springs of Spring onions (bulbs included)</li>
	<li>1 green chillie</li>
	<li>1/2 cup of tamarind juice</li>
	<li>small piece of ginger</li>
	<li>Pinch of white and black salt</li>
	<li>Juice of 1/2 a fresh lime</li>
</ul>
<b>Procedure :</b>

Mix in all the above ingredients in a mixie jar.

Serve with snacks or meals.
