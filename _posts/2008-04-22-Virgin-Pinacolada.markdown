Being a person who has never tasted an alcoholic drink upto date I always wondered what the cocktails must taste like. One day I ran into a Mocktail counter at a food court and realized that people who dont drink liqueur also have delicious options. I had a <em>Virgin Pinacolada</em> and it was delicious! Since then whenever I got a chance I ordered this drink. The sweetness in the coconut milk perfectly balances the sourness in the pineapple juice. Every milky sip of this tropical fruit drink leaves your taste buds wondering whats tasting so good.

In Spanish, Pina Colada means 'Strained Pineapple'. In 1978 it was such a popular drink in Puerto Rico that it was declared the National drink of the country. A very <a href="http://www.texascooking.com/features/may2004pinacoladas.htm">interesting summer mocktail</a> indeed.

The best Virgin Pinacolada I ever had was a couple of months ago on our wedding anniversary. We had been to this fancy place called <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/FoodandWine/Taj%20Residency,BANGALORE/MEMORIES%20OF%20CHINA/default.htm">Memories of China</a>. The Colada there was just too perfect. I hoped the glass would never finish. The texture was creamy and temperature of the drink was perfect.

I tried to recreate some of the magic. Lets see if it matches up! This is my entry to the <a href="http://simpleindianfood.blogspot.com/2008/03/fun-n-sun-event-announcement.html">Fun 'n' Sun Event</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/18260908935271427941">EasyCrafts</a>.
