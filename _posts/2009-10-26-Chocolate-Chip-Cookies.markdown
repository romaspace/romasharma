Finally I made them! Thanks to my sister who baked cookies and inspired me to follow suit. My niece goes to this fun activity center called <a href="http://hippocampus.in/index.html">Hippocampus</a>. Its a place where kids can read, learn and play at the same time. The center conducts cooking classes for kids from time to time -  involving them in making simple things like sandwiches, muffins and cookies. Thats where I got this recipe from. I personally love the idea of involving kids in cooking as it encourages them to eat better and also serves as a good distraction for mommy and baby.

When I made these cookies I didnt have chocolate chips so I used broken chocolate bits instead. I searched all over but Bangalore doesnt seem to provide you with chocolate chips that easily. Finally found them at the Nilgiris on Brigade road.  I also got many other ingredients from there like chocolate vermicelli, liquid glucose and doughnut baking molds - stuff thats  hard to find around here.
