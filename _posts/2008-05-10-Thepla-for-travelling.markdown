Being the mother of a little baby and a frequent traveller I'm constantly on the look out for good homemade dishes with a long shelf-life. Thepla is a Gujarathi version of the <a href="http://romasharma.com/2008/04/02/methi-malai-paratha/">methi paratha</a> and is one such dish which can be preserved for over a week. I packed this for dinner during our train travel a couple of weeks ago. The parathas were soft and tasty. They were supposed to last for a week but we finished them off in one sitting!! :-)

In the train I met a Gujarathi aunty who told me about a lot of other breakfast recipes that can be preserved for a long time (typically snacks and savories made out of besan and deep fried)

Try thepla for your next week-long trip. This paratha is particularly useful to mothers who dont want to give kids any outside food. Also, sometimes you dont want to break your journey for a meal and would rather eat something on the drive.

This is my entry to the <a href="http://cooking4allseasons.blogspot.com/2008/04/announcing-event-to-celebrate-indian.html">roti mela</a> organized by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/03232972178979601709">Srivalli</a>.
