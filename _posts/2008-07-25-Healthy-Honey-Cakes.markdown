As a teenager I remember eating these delicious healthy honey cakes that my mom used to get from a 'Dieter's Bakery' on commercial street. Unfortunately, the shop closed after a few years and I did not know where to go then on for cakes that were actually good for health and liked by all.

Here is a version of the honey cake that I tried a few days ago. It isnt as delicious as the ones I used to have earlier but never the less its a start.

Kaila tried this recipe out. Here is her <a href="http://kailaskitchen.blogspot.com/2008/07/honey-muffins.html">experience</a>. She has used an excellent variation of adding nutmeg to the cake giving it a great flavor and aroma. One thing I forgot to mention in my notes is that brown sugar is much sweeter than the other sugars I have eaten so far. So in case you substitute the sweetening agent with anything else please increase the quantity. Thanks Kaila for bringing this to notice. I have added this to my notes.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>3/4 cup wheat flour</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons butter (low cholesterol, unsalted)</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons malai (milk cream)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
	<li>milk 1/2 cup ( to make a dropping consistency )</li>
	<li>Pinch of fruit salt, baking powder and salt</li>
	<li>Few drops of vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the dry ingredients well.</li>
	<li>Beat butter with sugar till light and fluffy.</li>
	<li>Add the wheat flour mixture to this little by little.</li>
	<li>Add milk cream, honey, vanilla essence and mix well.</li>
	<li>Now add milk and beat well. The milk should be just enough to make the batter drop off the spoon.</li>
	<li>Grease and dust cake molds. Pour the batter into the molds and bake at 200 Deg C for 15 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>This cake is quite filling. Its better to make it in molds smaller than the ones shown in the picture.</li>
	<li>I found brown sugar to be much sweeter than other sugars. So in case you substitute the sweetening agent from brown sugar to anything else like white sugar, jaggery, etc; please increase the quantity.</li>
</ol>
