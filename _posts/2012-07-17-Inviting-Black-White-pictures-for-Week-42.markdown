<div>I'm guest hosting Black &amp; White Wednesday (BWW) for week #42. This event has been around for a long time now and everyone has been enthusiastically participating in it with their culinary B&amp;W photographs. I personally love B&amp;W pictures. Their ability to highlight subjects helps convey the essence of a shot better.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whenever I get a chance I like to observe pictures that were shot during the times of our grandparents. The simple B&amp;W pictures speak volumes of the times back then. I am truly happy to be guest hosting B&amp;W Wednesday Week #42. Looking forward to your participation.</div>
