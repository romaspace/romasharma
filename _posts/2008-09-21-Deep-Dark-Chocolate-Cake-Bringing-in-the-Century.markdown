I have always been a huge fan of chocolates in any form right from truffles to cakes, icecreams to cookies and a Deep Dark Chocolate cake has the potential to satisfy any chocoholic's craving.

Rich chocolate cakes are irresistible whether as a part of hot chocolate fudge or a black forest pastry. More than chocolate its the dark chocolate versions that I am fond of as I prefer chocolate bitter to sweet. If you share my taste and craze please try this out. I am sure you wont be disappointed. Whats more? Its really simple to make. You can find the <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/recipes/recipes/detail.asp?id=4608&amp;page=1&amp;per=1&amp;keyword=deep%20dark%20chocolate%20cake#content_area">recipe </a>at the Hershey's site. There was a point in time when I added boiling water to the batter and soon began to feel that the end of this cake was near! The batter became so thin and watery that I was wondering whether I should go ahead and bake it or not. Anyway, Hersheys is a trusted chocolate company for decades. The recipe said the batter will be thin so I just closed by eyes and went ahead. Once the cake was ready I opened my eyes and I couldnt believe what I saw! It looked gorgeous and tempting as ever. Its a must-try for chocoholics. Please follow the recipe of <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/recipes/recipes/detail.asp?id=4608&amp;page=1&amp;per=1&amp;keyword=deep%20dark%20chocolate%20cake#content_area">Deep Dark Chocolate cake</a> by Hersheys.

Some changes I made to the recipe :
1) I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and baking soda each.
2) I used 1.5 cups of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of plain sugar.

This is my 100th recipe and I could think of no other dish that is closer to my heart than this one. Here comes the century! More than the recipes I am so happy about the number of friends I have made on this journey. I have learnt a whole lot from you guys. Thanks so much for being with me and inspiring me with your recipes in my Space.
