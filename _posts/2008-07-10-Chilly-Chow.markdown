I am a great fan of Chinese cuisine. I really dont know where to stop. Right from soups &amp; starters to noodles &amp; wontons, everything drives me nuts. Usually at restaurants I end up ordering from a standard set of dishes which I know will be enough for a whole meal. For instance, Triple fried rice, American Chopsuey and vegetable steamed rice. Why do I try to order one-meal dishes?? Thats because Hubby dear will order North-Indian food and smile at my Chinese. So here, I am pretty much on my own :)

Chilly Chow is another dish thats deliciously spicy and quite filling. This is my entry to Archana's <a href="http://www.archanaskitchen.com/2008/events/monthly-one-dish-event-meals/">One Dish Meal Event</a>. Its really a great idea of have a collection of recipes where a dish is sufficient for the entire meal. Some day when you return home exhausted after a long shopping spree this set of recipes will help. Thanks Archana, for hosting this <a href="http://www.archanaskitchen.com/2008/events/monthly-one-dish-event-meals/">event</a>.
