I must thank Lakshmi of <a href="http://www.tasteofmysore.com/">Taste of Mysor</a>e for introducing me to the concept of making comics. I enjoyed making my own story, moreover the <a href="http://www.makebeliefscomix.com/comix.php">tool </a>was user friendly making it easy to create my own comic strip. This is my entry to <a href="http://www.tasteofmysore.com/2008/05/create-comic-anouncing-fun-and-no.html">Comic Cooking with Brinjals</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/03954537572297159735">Lakshmi</a>.
