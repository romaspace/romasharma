Its impossible to make a type of tea that everyone will like. Some like it with more sugar, some with more milk, some want the tea leaves to be boiled more and others don't want it boiled at all! It really amazes me that a simple thing like tea can be made in so many ways to suit so many people.

However, <em>masala chai</em> is something thats a safe bet for all of us. It directs your attention towards flavors that unfold with every sip.

Its interesting to note that tea has many <a href="http://greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=000N2K">medicinal properties</a> as well. <em>Masala chai</em> is particularly helpful if someone has a cold.
