Dehra Dun is the place I visit every summer since childhood days.  My maternal Grandparents have been there for decades now. DD is situated on the foot hills of Himalayas. Its amongst the most laid back and scenic cities I have seen. Mussorie is uphill and only 30 kms away from DD, they are almost like twin cities.

As you drive out of the house you are surrounded by huge mountains that envelope DD. The air is pure due to the high density of trees. If you drive slightly out of the town you can find deer walking by the side of the road, just like that! Breathing the fresh air for a week can make you addicted to the land.

Almost everyone in DD has a big beautiful garden outside their home. This makes the environment colorful and aromatic. If you set out on the road you will find mostly bungalows and villas artistically laced with blooms. Something about the soil and air of DD, flowers grow extremely well even if left uncared for.

Here are some snaps I brought back with me. The break at Dehra Dun was so rejuvenating. Not to mention how light my pockets feel after all the shopping.
