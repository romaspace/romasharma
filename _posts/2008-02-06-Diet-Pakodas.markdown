<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Diet Pakodas</strong></span>

On a diet? Ever felt yourself reaching out for a sinful bite of delicious pakodas? Well, then this is an answer to what will satisfy your taste buds and keep a check on the calorie meter. Its a healthy snack which is not only nutritious but also keeps you full for longer. Try it for kids who like deep fried junk food. Don't forget to give it a tastier name before you present it to them :-)

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>4 slices of bread</li>
	<li>1 cup whole green moong dal</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons of Besan</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons of <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/pudina-chutney/">Pudina chutney</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Soak moong dal overnight.</li>
	<li>Grind it into a paste with water, besan and pudina chutney. Since chutney already contains salt you might need to taste and add more salt accordingly.</li>
	<li>Make <a href="/2008/02/spring_toasts.jpg">bread cubes</a>. Dip each cube into the dal batter and toast on a hot greased pan.</li>
	<li>Once done on both sides, serve hot with tomato ketchup.</li>
</ol>
