Dear All,

I have been blessed with a baby girl one week ago. My 3-year old daughter is really excited about the new arrival. We have named her Trisha (meaning: desiring)

I know some of you must be wondering where I've disappeared these last few months. My pregnancy had made me weak and completely cut off from any kind of kitchen work. I couldnt tolerate smells or cook with ease. Thats the reason behind my fairly blank and un-updated blog. Hopefully in few months from now I will be back with more recipes which I will be trying out for  my baby girl. For now, its months of nappy changing and lullaby singing. See you at the other end of it... cheers!
