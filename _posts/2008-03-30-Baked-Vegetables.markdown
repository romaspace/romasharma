This is one of the oldest and all time favorite recipes of mine. Somehow I never got a chance to make it. May be because I was always skeptical about my baking skills.

Today I managed to bake this for our Special Sunday lunch. It turned out well. I intentionally made it a bit lighter than the original recipe because my husband cant digest heavy milk products in his food.

Being a total Indian at heart I couldn't keep oil out of this dish. So I tweaked the original recipe a bit to suit my requirement.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon maida</li>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon grated cheese</li>
	<li>Pepper Powder (freshly roasted and ground)</li>
	<li>1 cup mixed vegetables :
<ul>
	<li>Red , Yellow, Green pepper</li>
	<li>Mushroom</li>
	<li>Baby Corn</li>
	<li>Carrot</li>
	<li>Beans</li>
	<li>Peas</li>
	<li>Spinach</li>
	<li>Finely chopped Garlic</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Macaroni</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon of Olive Oil</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons of bread crumbs</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>For the White Sauce</strong></span>
<ol>
	<li>Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add maida and fry till it turns opaque.</li>
	<li>Add milk and boil the sauce. If it appears too thick add more milk till the sauce is moderately pasty.</li>
	<li>Add grated cheese, salt and pepper. Mix well.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Preparing the Vegetables</strong></span>
<ol>
	<li>Stir fry vegetables in oil with some salt till they are half cooked.</li>
	<li>Boil pasta with a Pinch of salt, till its soft. Mix into the stir fried vegetables.</li>
	<li>Add the white sauce to the mixture of vegetables and pasta.</li>
	<li>Add some pepper powder. Mix well.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Baking the Dish</strong></span>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven at 200 °C.</li>
	<li>Pour the vegetable pasta mixture into a baking dish.</li>
	<li>Pour Olive Oil over the dish and mix well.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle bread crumbs on top.</li>
	<li>Bake at 200 °C for about 15 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>In this dish salt is added a number of times at different stages of preparation. Care needs to be taken to ensure that the overall quantity of salt does not become too much.</li>
	<li>If you don't have bread crumbs you can quickly make them. Microwave a piece of bread for 30 secs and leave it outside till it dries up. Crumble it and sprinkle over the dish.</li>
	<li>While preparing the white sauce pour warm milk into the fried maida. This will prevent lump formation due to temperature difference.</li>
</ol>
