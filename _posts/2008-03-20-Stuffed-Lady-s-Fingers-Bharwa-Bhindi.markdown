<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Bharwa Bhindi</strong></span>

This sabzi is usually prepared to take along while traveling. The masalas keep the bhindi pickled for 24 hours. I personally like it so much that often I made my mother make it even when we weren't going anywhere.

The masalas in this case completely change the taste of bhindi. This is a must try, for those of you who dont like Bhindi or are bored of the usual style of cooking it.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>250 grams Bhindi</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon Oil</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon Tamarind paste</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Jaggery</li>
	<li>4 teaspoons <a href="http://romasharma.com/2008/03/30/tawa-masala/">Tawa masala</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Heat Oil. Add Tamarind paste. If you dont have tamarind paste you can add amchur powder.</li>
	<li>Add Jaggery and mix well.</li>
	<li>Put tawa masala in and turn off the heat. The consistency of the paste should be thick, like halwa.</li>
	<li>Slit bhindi. Stuff the masala into it and shallow fry in hot oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the bindis (remember stuffing already has salt)</li>
	<li>Once bhindi appears done, serve hot with rotis.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>If you buy ready-made tawa masala you will need to taste and see if it contains salt or not. If it doesn't, please add some to it.</li>
	<li>If your tawa masala contains amchur or dry mango powder then please skip adding tamarind paste.</li>
</ol>
