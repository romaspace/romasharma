I came across a recipe show on tv by the name '<a href="http://www.ndtvgoodtimes.com/lifestyle/GoodTimesShowPage.aspx?ID=633425834723438750&amp;ShowCatID=2&amp;ShowID=25&amp;ShowCatTitle=Food&amp;ShowTitle=The%20Chef%20and%20His%20Better%20Half">The Chef and his better half</a>'. They show you how to make dishes from international cuisines. The part I like the most is their desserts section. Most dishes are baked and very attractive looking.

I remember seeing <em>Yummy Orange Pudd </em>about a month ago. It seemed pretty easy to make and looked tasty too. The chef said that he makes this pudding for his wife whenever she feels low. It really helps cheer her up. I thought "wow! I could use a dish like that too!"

Yesterday when I went to the supermarket I found juicy oranges in abundance. The Orange pudd came flashing back to my memory. I picked up a kilo and got cracking. So here is yummy orange pudd<em> </em>for you. I didnt make the orange sauce though I'll provide you with the recipe. Basically, I couldnt wait to dig into the pudd!
