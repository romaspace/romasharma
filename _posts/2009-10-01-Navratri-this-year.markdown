Just back from a 10 day vacation at Bombay. Visited my parents-in-law for the navratri week. We had a Garba night at our apartment just before we left for the trip. Here is a snippet.  Its a Gujarati number 'Nadi Kinare'. Actually, I didnt really understand the lyrics but thoroughly enjoyed dancing to it. There is one thing I now know - Just a 3 minute Garba can tire you as much as 15 mins on a tread mill. Its only when I attempt something like this that I realize I'm getting old :)

<!--more-->The lighting was poor so the video didnt turn out that great. A big thanks to <a href="http://anujohari.wordpress.com/">Anu</a> for patiently choreographing and conducting rehearsals for two weeks.

On 21st Sep we left for Bombay by train. The Pune-Bombay stretch is really awesome!!

Finally we reached home at Kalyan and witnessed a heavy down pour which lasted nearly 24 hours.

During our stay we had a chance to visit Matheran - a small hill station, near Kalyan. It was about 40 mins by local to a station called Neral. From there a 30 min cab ride up the hill and then another 2 kms by a hand-driven cart. Matheran has a small and pretty reasonably priced market. After Bangalore I find all places reasonable, really! Especially if we are talking about clothes or footwear.

I tried taking a horse to visit the view points but got really scared so we went sight seeing in a hand driven cart again. Its feudal. I really wish they would make provisions for vehicles to drive inside someday. Anyway, the view points were awesome, I specially liked the lake that was flanked on both sides by mountains. There was a bed of yellow flowers on one side with a house. A Lucky chap  lives there.

We returned from Matheran in about two days just before our festival of Naumi. We had a nice puja and delicious prasad on Naumi - kheer, puri, vada and  sweets. Above is the picture I took of the railway quarters near our house (just one evening before we left). I simply love the rustic look they wear.

We took the early morning flight back to Bangalore yesterday. Saw plenty of news channel vans on Mumbai air port covering the <a href="http://business.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/30/air-india-pilots-call-off-strike.htm">Air India Strike</a> that was on. Now we are back home running around doing the usual. This festive season was so action packed and memorable.
