This Maharashtrian delight needs some more time and effort to make as compared to other breakfasts but once its done its worth the effort you put into it. To make it nutritious you can replace potatoes with other vegetables like cabbage and beans. You can also skip the extra dollops of butter that are added to toss the fat out of the dish. This kind of a bhaji when eaten with a brown bread pav can completely change this dish into a very healthy option for calorie conscious people.

Right now I am presenting to you the original style in which it is made :

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 Potato</li>
	<li>4 Tomatoes</li>
	<li>2 Onions</li>
	<li>1 Capsicum</li>
	<li>1/2 cup Peas</li>
	<li>a few florets of Cauliflower</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Ginger garlic paste</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons Pav Bhaji masala</li>
	<li>1 lemon</li>
	<li>Pav bread</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Boil Cauliflower, peas and potato. Mash once done and set aside.</li>
	<li>Heat a kadai. Take some oil and fry the onions. Once they discolor add ginger garlic paste and Pav bhaji masala. After a few minutes add finely cut tomatoes, capsicum, salt, 2 large dollops of butter and fry till the oil leaves the sides of the pan.</li>
	<li>Now add the mashed vegetable and continue to cook for 5 more minutes. Once done, squeeze the juice of a fresh lime into it.</li>
	<li>Garnish the bhaji with coriander leaves. Heat the pavs on a pan with some butter.</li>
	<li>Serve Pav Bhaji with finely chopped onions and small pieces of fresh lime.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>If you like a thick gravy in the bhaji you can add some cornflour paste to the bhaji eventually and cook for a few minutes. For this, you need to dissolve 2 tablespoons of cornflour in 1/2 cup cold water and stir to obtain a paste.</li>
	<li>I personally don't like food color, although most people do add reds and oranges to their Bhaji.</li>
</ol>
