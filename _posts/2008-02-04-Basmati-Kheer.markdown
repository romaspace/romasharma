<strong>Ingredients : </strong>
<ul>
	<li>1.5 cups of Basmati rice</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons of ghee</li>
	<li>Few pieces of chopped Badam, Kaju, Kismis, elaichi</li>
	<li>Few strands of Kesar</li>
	<li>Milk 1.5 litres</li>
	<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>100 grams khoya</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure : </strong>
<ol>
	<li>Soak rice for an hour and wash till milkiness goes away.</li>
	<li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons of ghee in a cooker and fry the rice for sometime. Add 2.5 cups of water and pressure cook till rice is done.</li>
	<li>In a kadai heat remaining ghee and fry the badam, kaju and kismis in it. Once done, take them out of the kadai and fry the cooked rice in it.</li>
	<li>Now add 1 litre of boiled milk and mix well with the rice, stirring continuously. Once thick, add another 1/2 litre milk and continue to cook.</li>
	<li>Heat a small quantity of milk in a vessel and add the khoya to it after mashing. Let it boil once. Add this to the kheer and stir well with mathani (a long stirring rod with plates at the end).</li>
	<li>Mix kesar in small quantity of milk and mix into the kheer, stirring continuously.</li>
	<li>Once kheer is thick, add the fried dry fruits, sugar and teaspoon of ground elaichi and mix till sugar dissolves.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Khoya needs to be boiled in small quantity of milk so as to ensure that it isn't sour. If it is, the milk will split and the rest of the kheer will be safe. In this case you may have to try thickening with malai (cream of milk).</li>
	<li>The above recipe makes a thick kheer. If you like it thin, please add some more milk towards the end and boil well.</li>
</ol>
