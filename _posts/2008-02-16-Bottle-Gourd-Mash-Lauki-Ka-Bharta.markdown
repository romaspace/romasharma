<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Lauki Ka Bharta</strong></span>

This is for all those people who run away at the very thought of eating bottle gourd. Despite its nutritional value we tend to avoid it for its bland taste.

<em>Lauki Ka Bharta</em> is another dish invented by accident. About 6 years ago, I was cooking a meal for myself and my father when my mother was out of town. There was this bottle gourd at home and I simply didn't know how to cook it. I remember mom telling me that it takes long to get done but I didnt have the patience to wait that long. So <em>lauki ka bharta</em> was created.

Surprisingly, it tasted well. My cook these days, makes it with a twist of his own which does justice to the original recipe.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 medium sized Lauki (Bottle Gourd)</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon Rai</li>
	<li>1-2 Green Chillies</li>
	<li>Few Curry leaves</li>
	<li>2 Tomatoes</li>
	<li>1 Onion</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon Ginger-Garlic paste</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Haldi powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Mirchi powder (optional)</li>
	<li>2 teaspoon Dhania powder</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Pressure cook lauki. Mash and let it cool.</li>
	<li>In a kadai heat oil. Add rai, chillies, curry leaves, onions and saute well.</li>
	<li>Now add ginger-garlic paste and fry for a few minutes. Add tomatoes and fry till they go brown.</li>
	<li>To this add haldi powder, mirchi powder, dhania powder, salt and the mashed lauki.</li>
	<li>Mix well, beating the lauki with your cooking spoon (poor lauki!)</li>
	<li>Since the lauki is already cooked this dish is ready quickly. After the mixture comes together, turn off the heat, garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with rotis.</li>
</ol>
