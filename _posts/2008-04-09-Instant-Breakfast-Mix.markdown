<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Instant Breakfast Mix</strong></span>

<a href="/2008/04/instant_breakfast_mix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-242" src="/2008/04/instant_breakfast_mix.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300" /></a>

Has it ever happened to you that you are so late to work that you could not whisk up something to eat? Morning hours are always action packed at my place.
Every minute is important. However, some ready mixes make life easier. <em>Instant Breakfast Mix</em> is one such solution.

Once you make this mix ready it can be stored in an air-tight container for upto a month. Whenever you need to eat it just moisten it with some warm water, stir in a spoonful of ghee and mix well. Thats the maximum you need to do for a delicious breakfast. No need to even turn on the stove! Just warm 1/2 a cup of water for 20 s in a microwave. If you dont have a microwave use water from your geyser ( Ohh! JUST Kidding!! )

<strong>Different ways in which this can be eaten :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Simplest is as a Namkeen (Savoury mixture) with tea</li>
	<li>You can add finely chopped cucumber, onion, tomato, coriander leaves and eat it like Bhel.</li>
	<li>It can be moistened and eaten as a regular breakfast</li>
</ol>
<strong>Advantages of this mix :</strong>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Time saver</strong> - When you cant prepare breakfast in the morning rush hour</li>
	<li><strong>Any place meal</strong> - Useful while traveling with a baby and you dont want to give him outside food</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;">In fact, thats how I came up with this recipe. I am going for a week long holiday and I dont want to give my one year old girl any train food. I am going to prepare this mix, moisten it with regular water and feed her at least one meal with this mix. You dont really have to use warm water, even normal room temperature water will work. Just that we all like to have food thats a little warm hence the recommendation.
Mixing of ghee before eating is important because while roasting we have not added any oil. That makes the masalas settle at the bottom of the poha, not mixing well into the dish. Once you add ghee the masalas will coat the poha evenly, making it tasty.</p>
<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup beaten rice (poha - thin flakes)</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons ground chutney dal powder</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon Channa dal</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon white Urad dal</li>
	<li>Few curry leaves</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon Red chillie powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Dry Tamarind powder</li>
	<li>Pinch of turmeric powder</li>
	<li>Pinch of hing</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Procedure :</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Heat the kadai. Add the mustard seeds, channa dal, urad dal and allow them to splutter (although there is no oil the hot kadai will crack them)</li>
	<li>Add curry leaves, ground chutney dal powder and roast well.</li>
	<li>Now Add poha and continue to stir till the Poha is crispy.</li>
	<li>Add hing, turmeric powder, red chillie powder, dry tamarind powder and salt. Mix well.</li>
	<li>Dont cook much more as the masalas will settle at the bottom of the poha and get burnt.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Variation :</strong></span>

If you want to improve the taste (and reduce the shelf life!) this is what you can do. To the mustard seeds and curry leaves add some roasted and ground groundnut powder. Instead of tamarind powder use Amchur / Dry Mango powder. Follow the remaining procedure in the same way. This mix will be tastier but will last for about a week.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>To Store :</strong></span>
Store this mixture in an air tight container. Use a dry spoon while taking it out.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>To Eat :</strong></span>
No need to turn on the stove.
Just dampen the poha mix will some warm water and add a spoonful of ghee. Mix well. Be careful not to pour water in as poha might become soggy.
