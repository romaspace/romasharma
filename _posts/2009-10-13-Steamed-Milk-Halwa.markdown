My Sunday morning started off with scanning the Mint newspaper supplement. It was fully loaded with ideas for Diwali Gifts and some interesting recipes from Top Chefs. I particularly liked Tarla Dalal's ideas for Low-Fat paneer and Khoya that can easily be made at home. Low fat khoya is made by steamed a dough of skimmed milk and water. This dough is then mashed and flavored with sugar and essence of choice. I wanted to immediately put this idea into action but I didnt have enough skimmed milk so I used the badam milk powder that had been chilling in my fridge for way too long.

<!--more-->Since the mix already had sugar I skipped the sugar adding part and used an orange essence to flavor half the halwa. I think this sweet dish is really easy to make because all other halwas require constant stirring and monitoring. When I was making this one, I was watching a TV show as the halwa steamed itself to completion. As good as it gets...

Here is a picture of the Moon on Kawa Chauth. One of the most clear appearances the moon has ever made on this occasion. Every year we spend our time playing hide n Seek but not this time. I was delighted to see that the moon was beaming its bright face in the sky even before my Pooja Thaali was ready.

<strong>Please note:</strong>
Before making halwa please check the Sugar quantity in your Badam Milk mix by tasting it. Sometimes the mixes are very sweet making the halwa inedible. If you find excessive sugar in the mix you can cover for it by increasing the quantity of regular milk powder in the recipe.
