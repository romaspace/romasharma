<p>Yes! I saved two bananas. They were very ripe and were fast approaching their expiry when I decided to use them up. Usually I makeÂ  <a href="http://romasharma.com/2008/10/banana-walnut-cake/">banana cakes</a> or <a href="http://romasharma.com/2008/10/karwa-chauth/">Deep fried Dumplings</a> (Gulgule) when I find very ripe bananas lying in my kitchen. However this time I wanted to try something different so I decided to go with Banana Icecream. It was simple and easy to make, not to mention the difference in taste and price as compared to the store bought ones. These ice creams use fruit preserves hence taste synthetic and are non-nutritive. On the other hand the ones made at home have that natural taste of fruit like the one you enjoy in freshly prepared milk shakes. I am eagerly waiting for the mango season to make my next favorite ice cream.<!--more--></p>

<p>You can enjoy this ice cream with a biscuit fudge. I had a pack of digestive biscuits that had been lying on my kitchen shelf for way too long. I just blended the biscuits into a powder and made a simple fudge. Thanks to <a href="http://kailaskitchen.blogspot.com/2009/10/no-bake-chocolate-pinwheel.html">Jayasree of Kailas Kitchen</a> for giving me this idea. I spread two fat layers of fudge on a small plate and so I got these cookie-like pieces. To get a nice, neat swirl like Jayasree's you need to spread a thin layer of fudge on a big plate. The biscuit fudge can be eaten as such or as a part of an ice cream sundae.</p>
<p><strong>For the ice cream:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 small , ripe bananas</li>
<li>2 cups milk</li>
<li>3 TB sp sugar</li>
<li>2.5 TB sp milk pwd</li>
<li>pinch of cmc , gms</li>
<li>1/2 tsp banana ice cream</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cornflour powder</li>
<li>Few drops of vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure :</strong></p>
<p>1. Boil the milk. Separately make a paste of sugar, cornflour and milk powder with a small quantity of milk.<br />
2. Continuously stir the milk while putting the paste in.<br />
3. Mix the 2 chemicals CMC and GMS with little milk in a cup. Pour this into the boiling milk mixture.<br />
4. Add one teaspoon of liquid glucose separately in a small quantity of the boiling milk mix. Once you get a lump-free liquid, mix it back into the boiling milk mix.<br />
5. Cool this mix and pour into an ice cream box. Increase temperature of freezer. Freeze the mix.<br />
6. Once it becomes hard. Take it out and leave it outside for few minutes so that it can come out easily.<br />
7. Break it and churn a bit. Blend into a paste in a mixer jar.<br />
8. Add cold fresh cream, mashed banana and essence into the paste and churn well. (Should not be watery, only pasty!)<br />
9. Put it back in the ice cream box and reduce the freezer temp to normal.<br />
10. After 1-2 hrs check if ice cream has crystals. If so, churn it again and increase the temperature of the freezer.<br />
11. While serving place ice cream on biscuit fudge and with garnish chocolate sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Please NOTE :</strong></p>
<p>You need to mix liquid glucose well in the hot milk otherwise it will form lumps. If you want you can mix it first in a small amount of hot milk and then mix that into the boiling milk.</p>
