Now I know why this cake is called Devil's Food Cake. It's simply sinful ! It's made with a combination of rich molten chocolate and butter. The taste of this cake is determined by the quality of cooking chocolate used. It can be as delicious as you like. I suggest, you go for the best brand of dark chocolate available near your place. When we are sinning anyway, might as well go all the way :-)<!--more-->

You will find several different recipes for this cake. I have myself seen so many varieties that it was difficult to freeze on any one. Finally I just went through all of them, made some changes and came up with one recipe as per my taste. Anyway, left to myself I would bake a cake everyday. Moreover, chocolate being my favorite flavor I dont think I would bake many different flavors. It would at the most change to a mocha one, once in a way. I could get into a business of selling cakes. Just that, once its done I would give it away to my friends and family members after eating half myself. That way there would be nothing left to sell, so I could run into a loss. Hmmâ€¦ this cake has allowed the devil inside me out. My imagination is running wild and now I am thinking of living in a cake house with the devil himself. I think I should stop. Go ahead and try making some yourself. Indulge!!
