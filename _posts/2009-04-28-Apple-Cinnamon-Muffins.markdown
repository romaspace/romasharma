I found this cake to be particularly soft! Since applesauce is used as an egg substitute it has all the qualities that make a cake soft and spongy. Add a few eggs and now you have a cake thats even softer, yet well bound. 

Apples and cinnmon are a match made in heaven. Its rare to find a apple dessert that doesnt contain cinnamon. Its advisable to freshly prepare any spice powder by roasting and grinding the spice. This when added at the very last stage of bread making results in a lasting aroma. I tried roasting the cinnamon but didnt know that it burns so fast. I threw those poor charred sticks away and started again, very cautiously. This time I tossed them around constantly and turned off the gas as soon I got the fragrance of roasted cinnamon. The resultant cakes were soft and brown with a hint of cinnamon in them.

I have adapted this recipe from Mansi's <a href="http://funnfud.blogspot.com/2008/10/spiced-apple-bread-recipe.html">Apple Bread Recipe</a>. Thanks Mansi, for sharing this delicious recipe with us.

I made a few changes to the original recipe :
<ol>
	<li>I made it as a muffin since my baby likes small round portions</li>
	<li>I didnt add nutmeg powder and nuts</li>
	<li>I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to the flour while seiving</li>
	<li>I baked muffins at 175 °C for 25 mins</li>
</ol>
