Happy Birthday Mayank!

This cake is for you....

I spent a happy afternoon yesterday baking this cake for my husband. Followed every trick in the book to make the cake light and fluffy. I was cautious and used a recipe thats tried and tested from mom's bakery classes. When its an occassion you dont want to go wrong.

Well, he cut the cake early this morning. I was eagerly waiting for him to eat it. He said " Its excellent!" and I was happy.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Maida 150 grams</li>
	<li>Baking powder 1/2 teaspoon</li>
	<li>Cocoa - 20 grams</li>
	<li>Sugar - 175 grams</li>
	<li>Margarine (else unsalted butter) 115 grams</li>
	<li>Eggs - 3</li>
	<li>Milk 1/4 cup</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Sieve Maida, baking powder and cocoa three times.</li>
	<li>Cream fat with sugar until light and fluffy. You should be able to see pits of air on the surface of the butter.</li>
	<li>Whisk and egg at a time and add to the creamed mixture followed by one tablespoon of flour. Cream well.</li>
	<li>Add eggs in similar way and cream mixture well.</li>
	<li>Once the flour and eggs are all blended into the batter use a flat wooden spoon and cut the cake to fold in air.</li>
	<li>Add milk and blend into a pasty consistency.</li>
	<li>Grease a cake tin and pour in the batter. Bake at 200 deg C for 20 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>For Icing:</strong>
I have used a chocolate butter spread for the icing (like Nutella). Just heat the spread for a few seconds with milk and pour it over the cooled cake.
Decorate with brown sugar, cherries and serve.

<strong>Please NOTE</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Use a wooden spoon to beat the cake initially. Once the batter is almost ready, use a flat wooden spoon / knife to cut the cake while beating it. You need to move the flat spoon in a circular motion and cut it through the diameter of the circle. Repeat this kind of whisking a couple of times so air fills into the batter.</li>
	<li>Milk should be added to the cake batter only enough to make the batter drop from the spoon when lifted. The batter should not stick to the spoon or drop too freely.</li>
</ol>
