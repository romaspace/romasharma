Being a chocoholic by nature I'm always looking for ways to make chocolate desserts and goodies. Bet this wont make my doctor very happy. Anyway, here is the recipe of an almond chocolate fudge that I tried a few days ago. It was so delicious that I started eating it without even allowing it to set completely. Its too long to wait overnight to eat a yummy fudge. I shared this chocolate with a few neighbors and they liked it too. I'm sure this fudge is going to be a regular at our place given that its liked equally by kids and grown ups.

This is my entry to the <a href="http://simpleindianfood.blogspot.com/2008/07/wyfcolour-in-food-event_30.html">Color in Food</a> event hosted by EC of Simple Indian Food. Brown is the color of chocolate, which I simply love!

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Nestle Everyday Milk powder - 1 cup</li>
	<li>Brown Sugar - 3/4 cup</li>
	<li>Unsalted Butter - 1/3 cup</li>
	<li>Cocoa powder - 2 heaped teaspoons</li>
	<li>Water - 3/4 cup</li>
	<li>Milk - 1/2 cup</li>
	<li>Almonds (roasted and powdered) - 2 tablespoons</li>
	<li>Few drops of Chocolate milk essence</li>
	<li>5-6 Black Raisins (de-seeded)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Take Sugar in a heavy bottom pan and add an equal quantity of water.</li>
	<li>Cook the sugar syrup till a drop of it in plain water does not dissolve. That indicates its tight enough to bind.</li>
	<li>Reduce the flame. Now Add butter and stir quickly till it melts.</li>
	<li>Mix in milk powder and milk alternately. Ensure no lumps are formed.</li>
	<li>In case you find the consistency unmanageable then add some more milk. Ensure the mixture is pasty, not watery.</li>
	<li>Now turn off the heat. Mix in the cocoa powder, almond powder and raisins. Add a few drops of chocolate milk essence and beat well.</li>
	<li>Pour out chocolate fudge into a greased plate. Allow it to cool off and then give the fudge any desired shape.</li>
	<li>Dust it on powdered chocolate biscuits (alternately you can use roasted almond powder)</li>
	<li>Refrigerate overnight and enjoy chocolate fudge the next day.</li>
</ol>
