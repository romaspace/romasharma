There is a sweet history behind this recipe. It dates back to Feb, 2005 . One fine night when I walked into the kitchen there was nothing but a cup of curds and some methi leaves in the fridge. Potatoes are usually always there at home and I needed a curry that goes with rice. Thats how <em>alu methi kadhi</em> was created. Now its my husband's favorite dish and is made regularly at home.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup curd</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons besan</li>
	<li>1 large potato</li>
	<li>2 cups methi leaves (stems removed well)</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon Rai (Big)</li>
	<li>Few Red Chilly flakes</li>
	<li>2-3 teaspoons of vinegar</li>
	<li>Pinch of Hing</li>
	<li>Pinch of haldi powder</li>
	<li>Few curry leaves</li>
	<li>Finely chopped Coriander leaves</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Boil Potatoes and chopped Methi leaves. You can microwave them in water for 10 minutes to speed up the process.</li>
	<li>Blend the following ingredients in a mixie jar with 2-3 cups of water:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Curd</li>
	<li>Hing</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Besan</li>
	<li>Haldi</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Heat oil. Add rai, red chilly flakes, curry leaves and fry for a minute.</li>
	<li>Now add the curd mixture and let it boil till the raw smell of besan goes away.</li>
	<li>Strain the potatoes and methi leaves and mix them into the curry. Bring to boil.</li>
	<li>Once done, add vinegar and turn off the heat. Garnish with finely chopped Coriander leaves.</li>
	<li>Serve hot with plain rice.</li>
</ol>
