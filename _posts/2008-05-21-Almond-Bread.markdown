I have always been a great admirer of <a href="http://www.egglesscooking.com/">Madhuram's Baking</a>. For the longest time I have been wanting to try out one of her breads. Finally today I decided to make the almond bread as it looked delicious and straight forward.

I did not have almond butter so perhaps the bread did not get the brown color like hers, yet it was delicious. I flavored plain, unsalted butter with roasted and ground almonds. I also added some raisins to the bread batter. Thanks Madhu for making me realize how easy it is to bake a delicious bread. I am going to make it repeatedly, with a different flavor each time!

I think instead of a picture of the bread I should have posted a picture of my baby eating it. She was dragging me to the kitchen after every slice.

I made half the quantity described by <a href="http://www.egglesscooking.com/2008/05/20/eggless-almond-butter-bread/">Madhu's recipe</a>. Baked the bread for 200 Â° C for 30 mins.

Based on a request by Radha I have updated the measurements of ingredients used :

Maida / flour - 1 cups
Baking powder - 2 teaspoons
Salt - 1/2 teaspoon
Sugar - 2 teaspoons
Roasted and Ground almond powder - 1 tablespoon
Milk - 3/4 cup
Butter - 1/4 cup
