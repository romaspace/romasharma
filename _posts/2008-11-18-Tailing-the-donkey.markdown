Here is what I drew for the 'tailing the donkey' game for a friends Birthday bash. I know, it looks like it has rickets.

Its a typical party game where a kid is blind folded and given a marker. He is then left to draw the tail of the donkey. Once he is done, his name is written wherever he drew the tail. Of course, the guy who gets closest is the winner.

You can check out this <a href="http://www.dragoart.com/tuts/411/1/1/how-to-draw-donkey-from-shrek.htm">site </a>for a good step-by-step tutorial on how to draw a donkey. I just drew free hand, err... actually my hand was not totally free. It was tough to rescue this donkey from my baby doll.

Ok, running out now. Getting late for the party.
