<u><b>Badam Burfi</b></u>

One day I noticed a 200 gram packet of Badam Milk powder lying in my kitchen. It didnt have much use as I had already bought a different milk mix and was liking it too much to switch to something else. I wondered how to finish the Badam  mix quickly as these powders typically lose their flavor with time. I found the Badam Burfi to be a good way out.

<b>Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
	<li>400 grams Khoya</li>
	<li>Less than 200 grams Badam Milk powder (if its MTR it will contain sugar)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
	<li>Few teaspoons ghee</li>
	<li>Few teaspoons rawa</li>
</ul>
<b>Procedure :</b>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the Badam milk powder with khoya and saute well.</li>
	<li>Add milk and ghee to this mixture and cook on low flame, stirring continuously.</li>
	<li>Roast rawa and add to the mixture. Stir till mixture thickens.</li>
	<li>Pour mixture out on greased tray.</li>
	<li>Cool and cut into desired shape.</li>
</ol>
<b>Please NOTE :</b>

I have tried out the above recipe with MTR Badam Milk powder. However, if you use a badam milk powder of a different brand then you will need to check if it already has sugar or not and add some accordingly.
