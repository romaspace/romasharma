Yipee! My Grandmom and mom are here to stay with me. I feel like a kid running around happily. My 3-year old daughter feels double the excitement.  She says 'My nani has come with your nani?'

The word <em>Grandmom</em> is synonymous to a lot of things, like Delicious mangoes, Besan Laddus, Chocolate bars and Cream wafers. These are the things she used to treat me to whenever I visited her at Dehra Dun. I loved summers as a child. I would come back all plump from vacations to Granny's.  <!--more-->
<div id="_mcePaste">My friends came home a few days ago to have tea with me in the evening. It was a sudden plan, I got a call from one of them when I was clearing the dishes after lunch. A couple of my friends who stay in my apartment decided to drop in. I didnt have much time to make anything. I was planning to doze off with the baby. Thats when I thought 'May be its a good idea to make something that cooks on its own' I immediately decided to bake a bread. I kneaded the dough for 10-15mins and allowed it to stand in my kitchen balcony which is quite warm. While the yeast worked hard on the dough I was fast asleep with my baby :-)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">When I woke up it was inflated well enough. I gave it a few hard punches (believe me beating the dough is really therapeutic). I shaped it and put it into the oven to bake. The best part about doing all this is that it doesnt take up much of your time and you can actually sit down and talk to people who have come to meet you rather than stand in the kitchen deep frying till the smoke cooks your face.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">I seasoned the bread with the things that I like - carom seeds, Italian seasoning powder and pepper. However you can use chilly flakes, fenugreek leaves, garlic or anything else you like.</div>
<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>2 cups self-raising flour</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dry active yeast</li>
	<li>1.25 teaspoons of sugar</li>
	<li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
	<li>1 tsp refined oil</li>
	<li>Italian seasoning (dry mix of rosemary, oregano, thyme and basil)</li>
	<li>salt</li>
	<li>carom seeds</li>
	<li>pepper powder (or chilly flakes - as you like)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<strong>Procedure:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Heat a glass of water till it feels hot on your wrist  (not boiling hot !).</li>
	<li>Stir in the yeast and sugar till the yeast completely dissolves.</li>
	<li>Allow the yeast to proof.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile mix the flour with salt, olive oil, refined oil, pepper powder, carom seeds and Italian seasoning.</li>
	<li>Now mix the yeast liquid into the flour one tablespoon at a time. If you are left with yeast  liquid and the flour has already come together then you might have to leave it.  Sorry for the wastage.</li>
	<li>Now knead the dough for 10-15 mins. Stretch it away from you, fold it back into quarter and continue to knead in the same manner.</li>
	<li>Allow the Dough to rest in a warm place for about 1-2 hours.</li>
	<li>Once inflated, punch it down and knead very little. Shape the dough as you like and place on a greased baking tray.</li>
	<li>Allow it to rest for 5-10 mins. Then bake in a preheated oven at 180 deg C for 25-30 mins.</li>
</ol>
