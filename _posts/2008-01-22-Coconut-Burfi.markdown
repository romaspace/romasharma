Presenting two unique and delicious coconut burfi recipes. The first one is made with a sugar base and the second with a creamy thickened milk base. My personal favorite is the chilled coconut malai burfi, as it just melts in the mouth.

</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>

	<li>Heat sugar in a pan. Add a small quantity of water and mix it till it dissolves.</li>
	<li>Add sugar syrup to the coconut mixture. Mix well till the mixture thickens.</li>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Coconut malai Burfi (with milk) :</strong></span>

The picture above is of coconut malai burfi. It needs very simple ingredients and brings out the rich taste in coconut.

<ul>
	<li>Full cream milk 1/2 litre</li>
	<li>1 medium size Coconut</li>

	<li>Few teaspoons of sugar</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Soak kaju and badam for an hour. Grind them with fresh coconut.</li>
	<li>Boil 1/2 lt full cream milk. let it simmer till it thickens.</li>
	<li>Add the ground mixture and continue to cook. Add sugar, elaichi and thicken.</li>
	<li>Once done, pour out onto a greased plate. Cool and solidify in the freezer for a few hours.</li>
	<li>Cut into desired shape and serve chilled. You can decorate it with fried kismis for that extra yummy look.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>You can use <em>Nandini</em> orange packet which is a good 'full cream milk' option.</li>
	<li>Please be careful while adding sugar to this dessert as coconut is an ingredient which is already quite sweet.</li>
</ol>
