This is a minty spicy chutney which goes well with all chaats and snacks. Fresh Mint and coriander leaves can give this chutney a taste to remember. A Chutney being uncooked, is the healthiest way to consume our green leafy vegetables.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup fresh Pudina or Mint leaves</li>
	<li>1/2 cup coriander leaves</li>
	<li>1 green chillie</li>
	<li>A small piece of ginger</li>
	<li>Pinch of White and black salt</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon of amchur powder</li>
	<li>Few drops of fresh lime juice</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>

Grind the above ingredients in a blender and your Mint chutney is ready to be eaten.

<strong> Please NOTE : </strong>

To get a fine consistency you might need to add a few teaspoons of water. However, care needs to be taken as Mint and Coriander leaves have a high natural water content and the chutney should not eventually get watery.
