It was my younger Brother-in-law's birthday a few weeks ago and I decided to bake a cake for the occasion. He loves cakes but unlike me he is not very fond of chocolate cakes. So I started thinking of an eggless cake that is simple, non-choco and yet tasty. I started going through my mom's cookery notes when I stumbled upon this cake which was made from condensed milk. I had a can that had been chilling in my fridge for over a month, so I decided this was the best time to use it. Moreover, I had never really tried an eggless cake in a long time so I got cracking.

I am glad my BIL liked it very much. . Actually, although I bake cakes all the time its still a bit nerve racking when you bake for an occassion. You want to get it right. When I was turning the cake out of the mold for a second it got stuck and I was like 'God! Its for a party, let it not break !' Thankfully it came out clean and I was happy. Next comes the part when you want to taste it. Obviously, I couldnt taste it till it was cut. So I waited impatiently for the cake cutting. As soon as the cake was cut I jumped to have a piece. I was almost holding my breath and was hoping it wont end up as another one of those grand kitchen experiments. I felt like a kid waiting for her result. Thankfully the cake was delicious and I think I am going to make it more often.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 tin condensed milk</li>
	<li>100 gms maida</li>
	<li>50 gms butter</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>A pinch of salt</li>
	<li>1/2 cup water</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Mix condensed milk with melted butter.</li>
	<li>Add 1/2 cup of water and vanilla essence, beat until thoroughly blended.</li>
	<li>Sift together maida, baking powder, salt and soda. Blend in maida using <a href="/2008/06/cake_beating1.jpg">cut and fold</a> method. Let the batter reach dropping consistency.</li>
	<li>Grease baking tin and pour the mixture in. Bake in a preheated oven at 175 Deg C for 35 - 40 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please Note:</strong>
The same cake can be made in a chocolate flavor.

Just use 80 gms of maida (flour) and 20 gms of cocoa powder. Sieve the cocoa powder along with maida in step 3. Remaining ingredients and procedure is same as mentioned above.
