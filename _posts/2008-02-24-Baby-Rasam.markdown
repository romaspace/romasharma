<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Baby Rasam</strong></span>

<a title="baby_rasam_1.jpg" href="/2008/02/baby_rasam_1.jpg"><img src="/2008/02/baby_rasam_1.jpg" alt="baby_rasam_1.jpg" /></a>

Rasam rice is something I have noticed babies of this age enjoy quite a bit. However, we can not use the same rasam powder that we make for ourselves as it is too spicy for them.

By making a rasam powder of our own and with a little variation like adding the juice of vegetables, it can become an excellent alternative to the usual dal.

<strong>Rasam powder </strong>(for Babies)
<ul>
	<li>1 Cup Corriander seeds</li>
	<li>1/2 Cup Cumin seeds</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds</li>
	<li>1 tsp toor dal</li>
	<li>1 tsp ghee</li>
	<li>Pinch of hing</li>
</ul>
<strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Fry corriander seeds and cumin seeds separately till they release their aroma.
2. Heat 1 tsp ghee and fry fenugreek seeds, toor dal seperately and add hing.
3. Grind the mixture to fine powder.
