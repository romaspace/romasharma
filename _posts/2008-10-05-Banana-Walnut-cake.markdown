I have come across countless recipes for making this cake, it was really confusing which one to use. Anyway, I had to start somewhere so I picked this one which I found in a book at home, making some small changes wherever necessary. The main intention was to find out how good a substitute ripe banana is for eggs. Turns out, very!

In my circle of friends there are some people who are strict vegetarians. When I want to bake them a cake on occasions it becomes a bit difficult. This recipe is a sure shot solution to such problems. Its one of the best eggless cakes that I have had. Simply because the texture was as good as the cakes that contain eggs.

A very cute thing happened when I was making it. My maid was wondering why I was baking a cake out of bananas. I tried to explain that I like cakes very much. She said so cutely "There is a very nice bakery right outside the apartment where you get such cakes, why are you taking the trouble?" :-)

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 ripe banana ( long variety )</li>
	<li>3/4 cup flour</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>1.5 tablespoon milk</li>
	<li>less than 1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>less than 1/2 cup butter</li>
	<li>4 walnuts, finely sliced</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Puree the banana with the sugar and milk in a mixie jar.</li>
	<li>Sieve the flour, baking powder and baking soda together.</li>
	<li>Beat the butter until light.</li>
	<li>Mix in the banana batter and the dry powder alternately into the butter and beat well.</li>
	<li>Add more milk if required. The mixture should just drop off the spoon, also known as 'dropping consistency'</li>
	<li>Dust the walnut slices with flour and mix them into the batter.</li>
	<li>Grease and dust a cake mould. Pour the cake mix into it and place in an oven preheated at 180 Deg C.</li>
	<li>Bake at 180 Deg C for about 25 mins.</li>
	<li>Take the cake out of the oven. Brush the surface with milk and place back in the oven for about 5 mins. This will give it a shine and brownness on the crust.</li>
	<li>Take the cake out of the oven and cool on a wire rack. Cut out your slices and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
I always wondered how the homemade cakes that are sold in the market ( yes, you read it right! :) ) have such a glossy surface. I attempted the milk glaze which seemed really easy and safe to try. I was happy with the results as I got a good glaze on the surface without altering the taste.
