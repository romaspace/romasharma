I love anything with the word 'chocolate' in it. I am always hungry for chocolate and keep looking for ways in which I can add some to my 'diet'. While surfing around the net I found this <a href="http://www.cookingandme.com/2010/11/easy-basic-chocolate-brownie-recipe.html">easy recipe</a> to bake brownies by Nags. I couldn't wait much longer to try it out. My girls and I got together this afternoon and got this easy bake brownie out of our oven, safe and sound. Well, not for long because soon after the pictures the brownies vanished.<!--more-->

This is among the very few recipes in which I have melted the butter. Usually, I beat cold butter to make the cake light and fluffy. However, brownies are not intended to be fluffy. Thats the reasons why the butter is melted, very less baking powder is added and there is no baking soda used in the recipe. You can add molten chocolate to the batter to get a brownie thats even more rich and dense.

I loved the afternoon today. The summer is over and the rains have set it. With the play areas drenched outside we soon need to find ways to keep our kids busy indoors. My girls loved baking the brownies. Â I hid from the them and quickly took a few pictures in the balcony. Ohh! How I love the smell of wet mud on a rainy afternoon. Only to be accompanied by the smell of freshly baked brownies. Cheers!

Recipe adapted from <a href="http://www.cookingandme.com/2010/11/easy-basic-chocolate-brownie-recipe.html">Nag's brownies</a>. These brownies are off to join the royal celebration - the <a href="http://www.jagrutidhanecha.com/2012/05/announcing-event-celebrate-diamond.html">Diamond Jubilee event</a> hosted by Jagruti. I am also sending them to the <a href="http://ticklingpalates.blogspot.com/2012/06/announcing-lets-cook-16-kids-special.html">Lets Cook #16 - Kid's special event</a> hosted by Tickling palates.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup butter (unsalted)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
	<li>few drops of vanilla essence</li>
	<li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1/2 cup flour (maida)</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>

Melt the butter. Whisk in the sugar and essence.

Beat eggs separately. Add to the butter-sugar mix and blend into a smooth paste.

Add the dry ingredients - flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt.

Mix the batter to get a lump-free paste (do not beat).

Transfer batter into a greased and dusted cake tin.

Bake at 180 deg C for 30 minutes.

<strong>Please Note :</strong>

In this cake, instead of flour I used cocoa powder for dusting the cake tin. This gives the cake a nice brown pattern on the top.
