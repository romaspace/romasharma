Happy New year ! May 2010 bring happiness, health and prosperity to you all. Yesterday we had the most relaxed New Years celebration. We went to Niligiris Cake exhibition in St Josephs High School Grounds. Raina was excited about the Big Taj Mahal cake. She couldnt believe it was all cake. There was a long ship, folk dancers, flower baskets, horses, etc; all made out of cake. <!--more-->

Somehow this cake exhibition brings back a lot of memories. As a child I never missed the show even once. We would stand in long queues and drool over a hundred cakes. Everyone bought at least one little  pastry, if not a cake. Sure my mom has some nice memories too. It was a day after visiting the Niligiris cake exhibition that she went into labor. She delivered a breech baby (me :-)) a few days later. This exhibition is now 36 years old and guess how old I am going to be?

At night we had some mocktails and blasted music till midnight. Mayank, Raina and I put on some disco lights and danced till we dropped.  How we used the fact that one night in a year neighbors cant complain about noise. Sorry guys, no pictures of the mocktails. It was gone before we knew it. Baby was so tired after all the partying that she slept on her own right after the New year wishes went out. She woke up at 10.30 am today , played for a few hours and went back to sleep on her own! he he hee...is that a good sign? God, please tell me that all this year she is going to sleep on her own like this :-)

I made some mushroom manchurian and Mayank made Vegetable Pulao for lunch today. Mayank makes much better pulao than me. I dont want to learn, else I'll have to make it :-) I bought the manchurian masala from a sale that was attached to the cake show yesterday. Its the true dhaba taste that you get from buying spices from small shops. They are basically vendors who make Chinese food and who also want to pack the masalas off in small quantities to make some money out of it. I found the instructions on the packet so cute. It asked me to 'try' the pieces in hot oil (instead of fry). It also said that the manchurian will be very 'testy' Whats that now? May be I have to test it before tasting it :-)

Anyway, a nice lunch and now we are off to mom's place for a small new year party with Grand mom and sister. I was planning to make fruit cream. Somehow freezing the fresh cream made it granular. So I whisked it with sugar, flour and essence to make these orange short cakes. Some things created by accident are so tasty ...err...or should I say <em>testy</em>.
