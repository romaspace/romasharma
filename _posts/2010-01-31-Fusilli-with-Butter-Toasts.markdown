This was our Sunday morning breakfast. I had a lot of time at hand and techni color vegetables to go with it.  So I thought , why not make something that fills my stomach and my time? My daughter loves eating capsicums, especially if they are of different colors. Thankfully I managed to reserve some for the dish before she crept up from behind and ate it all raw! I used wheat fusilli that my dear neighbor got me from France. Its of fine quality- its firm, yet tender.  Its made of wheat, yet its tasty.

<!--more--> I must say that oven baked butter toasts taste so amazingly different from the ones grilled in a sandwich maker or a tawa. The toasts come out really crunchy, thats what re-baking does to them. Cooks them well till within and makes them taste fresh. Try placing your pasta on one of these toasts for a healthy breakfast.

My baby loves this dish and hence its off to <a href="http://spicingyourlife.blogspot.com/2010/01/announcing-kids-delight-wholesome.html">Kids Delight Wholesome Breakfast</a> hosted by Srivalli.
