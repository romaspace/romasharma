Every part of India has its own version of the <em>tomato chutney</em>. Some savor it as a pickle and others use it as a replacement for sabzis. Here is the tomato chutney we eat at home with a variety of parathas, usually for breakfast.

This chutney needs to be kept as simple as possible so that the natural flavor of tomatoes stands out. Moreover, we dont want the side dish to <em>fight </em>with the main dish.

If the chutney is to be eaten with a South-Indian snack, you can add some white urad dal and curry leaves to the tempering as well.
