People can have hour-long discussions on the topic of dieting. I feel all of us have tried to shed that excess weight at some point in life. Being a foodie I have always found it very difficult to keep away from yummy food. At the same time, I have been advised to lose weight by the doctors due to high cholesterol. So once a week what I do is, I just eat something that will taste as good as the yummy stuff others eat and at the same time has a calorie count that keeps me happy. Hopefully, my cholesterol level and weight will come down. My husband is not going to get my cholesterol checked for the next one year, in case its normal least I start binging again! :)
