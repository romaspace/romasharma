<div id="_mcePaste">This is probably what every North Indian dreams of drinking as soon as a raw mango is spotted some where around the market. I found one totally to my surprise a few weeks ago. I couldnt make panna coz...err.... I just ate it up raw! Actually to confess, I ate a whole lot of them with just salt and red chilly powder. One mango survived which made its way to this glass.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Aam panna is basically a raw mango squash. Its a great way to beat the heat. Just like any other mocktail there are  several add-ons that people like in it - mint leaves, ginger juice or even pepper. I am however giving you the basic recipe which you can twist as you like.<!--more--></div>

<div id="_mcePaste">Bangalore really needs a summer break. Feb 14th is the day summer actually set in. Bangalore recorded its second highest Feb temperature in the last 30 years! Poor couples who set out to celebrate Vanlentine's day. The sun had no mercy on them. It blazed with all its might. We were at  my daughter's annual day celebration. All I can say is that the ice cream stall made a lot of money that day.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">Ohh, before I leave let me tell you that my house was encroached upon by a couple of monkeys this week. I was away at a friends place for lunch while they decided to use my space for their's. They went straight into my kitchen picked up a milk tetrapack and a bottle of raisins, took it to the terrace and had a party. First they drank milk then they ate raisins and finally drank water out of Raina's sipper bottle! They even played with her bowling alley pins. Mayank suddenly heard a sound. He walked to the terrace only to catch the monkeys on a picnic. I just hope they know what they are doing. Eating a whole bottle of raisins they could end up with loose motions. What a way for them to learn not to encroach in future :-(</div>
<div>I am sending this drink to the <a href="http://ruchikacooks.com/?p=2022">Home Remedies event</a> hosted by Ruchika, also hosted a few weeks ago by <a href="http://a2zvegetariancuisine.blogspot.com/2009/12/home-remedies-series-1-our-first-event.html">A2ZVegetariancusine</a>. Thanks for dropping by and suggesting this entry to the event. Aam panna does help beat the heat through summer.</div>
