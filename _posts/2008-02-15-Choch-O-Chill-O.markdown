<u><b>Choch O Chill O</b></u> !

This drink is for all you chocoholics who want to beat the heat this summer, in style! Enjoy your Coffee on the rocks (<i>rocks </i>here refers to ice cubes please :-))

<b>Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
	<li>3/4 Glass milk</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon fresh cream</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon chocolate syrup</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon coffee powder</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
</ul>
<b>Procedure :</b>
<ol>
	<li>Blend milk, cream, sugar, chocolate syrup and coffee powder in a mixie jar. Now taste the mixture and add more sugar if required.</li>
	<li>Pour chocolate sauce along the inner sides of a tall glass, leave some sauce at the bottom too. Place a generous amount of ice cubes inside the glass. Pour the drink into your chocolate laden glass and serve.</li>
</ol>
<b>Please NOTE :</b>
<ol>
	<li>The milk and cream should both be chilled to get a good blend else the milk can make the cream split.</li>
	<li>Serve the drink immediately after blending it. If it reaches room temperature it will make the ice cubes melt quickly making your drink dilute.</li>
	<li>Since most of the space is taken up by ice cubes the drink you make with one glass measurement can actually serve two.</li>
	<li>I used Bru instant coffee, Amul fresh cream and Hersheys chocolate syrup in this drink and was satisfied with the result.</li>
</ol>
