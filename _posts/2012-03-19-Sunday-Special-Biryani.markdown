India is filled with so many different versions of rice cooked with vegetables. There is one called <em>tairi</em>Â in UP which is more like a pulao. Its rice infused with vegetables and cooked without any spicy ground paste. Then there is kashmiri pulao which contains sweet elements like pomegranate seeds and kesar milk. Finally the well-known <a href="http://romasharma.com/2010/01/10/shahi-dum-biryani/">Hyderabadi Dum Biryani</a> which is heavy due to the addition of curds and spices. In South India, we have masala bhath which also contains the known elements of pulao along with freshly ground coconut.<!--more-->

When it comes to making lunch on a Sunday I prefer these one-pot dishes like Pulao, Biryani or Khichdi. They are filling and delicious. Sometimes we also enjoy Mayank's yummy <em>dal chawal</em> which is actually comfort food for the entire family.

The biryani I made yesterday for our Sunday lunch is one I learnt from my friend and neighbor Cecilia. Its called 'red biryani' as it does come out quite red. Mine was orange as I added a little less of the secret ingredient. I didnt want to make it too spicy for the kids. Whats the secret ingredient? Well, its this amazing sambar powder she makes at home. I happen to have a pouch of it which I carefully hide in my kitchen and use for special dishes like this one.
