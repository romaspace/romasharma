A few weeks ago my 6yr old niece visited me. I thought it to be a good opportunity to bake a chocolate cake, her favorite and almost every kids delight. I didnt go for a rich chocolate cake, instead I decided to bake an eggless, mildly sweet cake with Chocolate syrup. Ohh yes! I have this big squeezy bottle of Hershey's chocolate syrup. Given that I dont eat too much icecream I wanted to use it in other ways. Well, this certainly was one delicious way to use up the syrup.
My niece was so excited about the whole procedure. While I was beating the cake , after about 5 mins she asked me , "Mausi, is your hand aching?". I found it so sweet!
I instructed her not to touch the oven and other heating equipment. She couldnt wait for 30 mins to eat it. She would keep running back to the oven to check how the cake was doing.
After it came out of the oven she was excited. I had to make her understand that I needed to take some pictures before she could dig in. She looked so confused and cute!
Finally the most awaited moment came. We got to eat it ! I liked the mild sweetness. When cakes are hot out of the oven they are so delicious that one can eat an entire loaf (beware!).
