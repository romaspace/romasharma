Porridge , Kheer or Payasam  is the most common dish given to babies. There is a  long list of base ingredients from which porridge can be made. In the description below, I have tried to cover most of them. The overall method is the same with only certain changes depending on the method of cooking the base ingredient used.

After boiling any of the kheers mentioned below you can add soaked &amp; ground almonds, elaichi powder and jaggery till it thickens.

<strong>Wheat vermicilli:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Coarsely grind the vermicilli.</li>
	<li>Roast in ghee till it becomes brown.</li>
	<li>Boil in milk till it softens.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Sabu dana :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Gives good relief to children who are suffering from loose motions.</li>
	<li>Soak sabu dana for 3-4 hrs.</li>
	<li>Boil in milk till it becomes transparent.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Coarsely ground rice :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Wash rice and dry it under the sun.</li>
	<li>Fry it in ghee and coarsely grind.</li>
