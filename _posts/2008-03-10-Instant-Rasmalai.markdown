<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Instant Rasmalai</strong></span>

The same old flavor of your favorite rasmalai can now be got very quickly and easily. Only constraint here is that you have to be an eggetarian to enjoy this short cut. I still haven't been able to find something that can substitute egg in this recipe and still retain the texture of the end result.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>50 g Milk powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>One egg</li>
	<li>1/2 lt milk</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon of Khoya</li>
	<li>Sugar (to taste)</li>
	<li>A teaspoon of Gulab jal</li>
	<li>Pinch of Elaichi powder</li>
	<li>Few strands of Kesar</li>
	<li>Pistas</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Mix milk powder with baking powder in a dry container.</li>
	<li>Beat an egg. Wet hands with the beaten egg and make a dough of the milk powder mix.</li>
	<li>Mix kesar in a small quantity of milk till it releases its color.</li>
	<li>Boil milk. Add sugar, kesar milk and elaichi powder to the milk and mix well.</li>
	<li>Make marble-sized pedas with wet hands and drop in boiling milk.</li>
	<li>Let it cook till the rasmalai bloats up and reaches the surface.</li>
	<li>Add khoya to the milk and stir till milk thickens.</li>
	<li>Cool and add gulab jal. Garnish with sliced pista and serve chill.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Although one egg is beaten in this dish we may not use the whole of it. Care should be taken to make the dough with hands wetted with the egg mix. If you pour the egg into the milk powder the dough will become a batter and things might get out of hand.</li>
	<li>In any dessert, gulab jal should be added only after dish cools.</li>
	<li>In the above recipe I used Amul milk powder and was satisfied with the dessert.</li>
