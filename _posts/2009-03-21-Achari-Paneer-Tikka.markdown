<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Heat mustard oil. Add Rai, Kalaunji, Saunf, kasuri methi, green chillies, fine chopped garlic, haldi powder, jeera seeds.</li>
	<li>Turn off heat and let it cool. Grind masala into a paste.</li>
	<li>In another kadai add mustard oil and saute paneer with some salt. Add the masala and stir well.</li>
	<li>The masalas are the typical ones used in pickles hence giving it its <em>achari</em> taste.</li>
</ol>

Finally you can heat coal, add a few cloves to it and pour ghee on it. Place this in the middle of the paneer bowl and cover. The flavor of coal will seep into the tikka giving it a very authentic <em>desi</em> flavor.
