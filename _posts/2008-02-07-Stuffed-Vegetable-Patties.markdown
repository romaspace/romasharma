<strong>For the cutlet :</strong>

	<li>Boil potatoes. Cool and mash well. To this add ginger, green chillies, jeera powder and salt. Knead well into a smooth dough.</li>
	<li>Make equal sized patties of the potato dough and stuff in the vegetable mixture.</li>
	<li>Keep the cutlets in the fridge for about 2 hours or more so that the potato dries up.</li>
	<li>Once you take it out of the fridge keep aside for 30 minutes so it can reach room temperature.</li>
	<li>Heat oil well. Dust the patties in rice flour and deep fry.</li>
	<li>Serve hot with tomato ketchup or <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/spring-onion-chutney/">Spring onion chutney</a>.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>When you take patties out of the fridge you need to let them reach room temperature before frying, else the temperature mis-match can cause them to split and scatter.</li>
	<li>Temperature control of oil is essential in this snack. Fry patties in hot oil. Dont fry more than 2-3 at a time else the oil will go cold.</li>
	<li>Once you take them out, allow the oil to heat up again before frying more patties.</li>
</ol>
