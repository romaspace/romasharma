I made asankhana's <a href="http://asankhana.blogspot.com/2008/08/lemon-rice-reminds-me-of-college-days.html">Grilled Tomato chutney</a> last night. Being a great fan of pickles and chutneys I couldnt resist the temptation of trying this delicious red dip. This recipe has a striking similarity to the <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/03/09/mashed-brinjal-baigan-ka-bharta/">original recipe of Baigan Ka Bharta</a>.

I made small incisions in the tomato and pricked the garlic pods into the tomato. Then I grilled the tomatoes using skewers and peeled off the black portion of the skin. This chutney is fairly easy to make and has that mildly burnt taste that gives any vegetable a complete twist in taste. Thats what I like so much about grilling.
