<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Mirchi - do - pyaaza</strong></span>

This is a dish I whisk up every time I have little or no time to make a sabzi. Back in school, I had a Maharashtrian friend whose mom used to make it with only onions and gram flour. Was one of the most delicious dishes I have had. I used to wait for veggies to exhaust at her home so I would get the besan onion delight.

<a href="http://culinarty.sapiensworks.com">Lore </a>has come up with an excellent idea of hosting and event of original recipes. This one is one of my very own creations and I would like to send it as an entry to the <a href="http://culinarty.sapiensworks.com/articles/original-recipes-culinarty-round-up-event/">Original Recipe event</a>. Thanks Lore, I think its a great concept!

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>10 Big chillies</li>
	<li>1 Big onion</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Jeera</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon ajwain</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon dhania seeds</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon saunf seeds</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons of Besan or Gram flour</li>
	<li>Amchur or dry mango powder</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The Chillies are basically the big light green pakoda chillies. You need to cut off the head of the chillie. Then slit it in the side and cut it into 2 halves.</li>
	<li>Separately dry roast the besan till it turns brown.</li>
	<li>Heat the oil. Add jeera, ajwain, dhania, saunf seeds. When seeds begin to crackle, add the sliced onions.</li>
	<li>Once onions turn glossy, add the chillies and salt. Cook till chillies are done.</li>
	<li>Add roasted besan, amchur and continue to cook till besan coats the chillies.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>The good part about this dish is that it takes less time to cook, so if you want you can substitute the chillies with capsicum or anything else which has cooking time equal to chillies/onions.</li>
	<li>Amchur should be added towards the end else it delays the process of cooking.</li>
</ol>
