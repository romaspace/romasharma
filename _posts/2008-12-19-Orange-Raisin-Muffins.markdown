This is again one of my kitchen experiments. Long ago my aunt told me that adding fresh orange juice to cake batter can create freshness in its taste. I also had lots of black raisins in my fridge. I remember buying these raisins as a humble substitute for blueberries. I love blueberry muffins but couldnt find any berries.

Finally, I thought of marrying the two ideas. Why not have an orange flavored cake which has black raisins in it? Here is the concoction. I must say its worth a shot. The end result was a shiny muffin in which the freshness of orange juice was interrupted by dark, sweet black raisins.

Off this goes to the original recipe event hosted by Lore. Merry Christmas!
