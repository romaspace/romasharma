Usually when we have methi leaves at home we either make <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/02/06/alu-methi-kadhi/">alu methi kadhi</a> or methi parathas.

<em>Methi paratha</em> is a very common breakfast in North India. Malai (milk cream) as been added to the original recipe to make the parathas softer. Since the dough contains raw methi leaves this paratha is more nutritious than the other parathas we usually eat. One tasty way to eat our greens!

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup Wheat flour</li>
	<li>1/2 cup methi leaves (without stems, finely chopped)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon gram flour</li>
	<li>Pinch of carom seeds</li>
	<li>Pinchof haldi powder</li>
	<li>Pinch of hing</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon malai</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the above mentioned ingredients along with water to form a smooth, soft dough.</li>
	<li>Roll out dough into parathas of desrired shape. Cook on tawa at medium heat. Apply oil on paratha from all sides.</li>
	<li>Serve hot with <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/tomato-chutney/">tomato chutney</a>.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Variation</strong></span>

You can skip adding <em>malai</em> and instead make a dough for <em>pooris</em>. Yes, <em>methi poori</em> eaten with mango pickle is equally delicious. Only take care to make the dough stiff.

<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Malai can be added to the dough of any paratha to make it softer.</li>
	<li>Avoid cooking parathas on slow flame as they can become papads.</li>
</ol>
