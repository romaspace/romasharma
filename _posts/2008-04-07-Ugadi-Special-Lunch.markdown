Ugadi is not really one of our festivals but since we have been in South India like forever, we have been influenced by the culture to some extent. We make a Special Ugadi Lunch every year to enjoy the festive spirit that surrounds us.

Typically in Karnataka they prepare Vobattu (jaggery rotis), thondekai sabzi, beans, kosumbari / salad, sambar and payasam today. I am unable to make the entire menu but do manage to make a few items here and there to feel like we have celebrated the day.

In the picture above you can see :
<ul>
	<li>Drumsticks and Mooli Sambar</li>
	<li>Tamarind rice</li>
	<li>Plain steamed rice</li>
	<li>Garlic papad</li>
	<li>Cucumber Kosumbari</li>
	<li>Beans sabzi</li>
	<li>Rice Payasam</li>
</ul>
Happy Ugadi to you all !!
