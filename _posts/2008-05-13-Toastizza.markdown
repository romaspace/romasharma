Being a great fan of pizza in any form this one is really special to me. When I dont have a pizza base ready at hand and really want a bite of a cheesy pizza I make these little Toastizzas.

I bought a bottle of <em>Maggie Pizza Sauce</em> a few months ago. It had a recipe booklet inside which suggested many different types of Pizzas. I liked Toastizza the most among them.

Toastizza is like an open sandwich which you can close with a grilled butter toast if you like. This is my entry to the <a href="http://food-n-more.blogspot.com/2008/04/announcing-sandwich-festival-2008.html">Sandwich Festival</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/07835843531587212609">Anupama</a>.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 bread slices</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons of Pizza sauce</li>
	<li>1/2 cup of chopped mixed veggies (onion, capsicum, mushroom, Fresh corn, Spring onions)</li>
	<li>Grated cheese</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Procedure :</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Heat oil. Cook mixed veggies until soft.</li>
	<li>Place bread slice on a greased oven plate.</li>
	<li>Apply Pizza sauce on it. Spread cooked veggies on it and sprinkle with some grated cheese.</li>
	<li>Preheat oven at 180 Deg C. Bake Toastizzas for 3-5 mins, till cheese melts.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Variation :</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>If you dont have Pizza sauce then blanch tomatoes and fry the puree in oil with some salt and pepper till it reduces to a sauce.</li>
	<li>If you want to eat it as a closed sandwich apply butter on a plain slice of bread and bake it along with your toastizza, by the side. Once done, close the toastizza with the grilled bread and enjoy your pizza sandwich.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Please NOTE :</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Check if your Pizza sauce already contains salt. Accordingly add salt to your veggies. The Pizza sauce I used had so much salt in it that I am glad I didnt add any salt at all!</li>
	<li>My Oven provides me a setting in which only the top filament gets heated in the oven. In dishes where the base is already cooked and only the top coat needs to be cooked ( like our toastizzas ) this mode should be used.</li>
</ol>
