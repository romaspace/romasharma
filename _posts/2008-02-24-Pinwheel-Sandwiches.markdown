	<li>2 slices of sandwich bread (large size)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon of cheese spread</li>
	<li>5 thin slices of tomatoes</li>
	<li>5 thin slices of cucumber</li>
	<li>Pinch of pepper</li>
</ol>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Cut off the edges of a large slice of bread.</li>
	<li>Place it on the clingfree side of a clig wrap.</li>
	<li>Roll the bread flat using a rolling pin.</li>
	<li>Mix cheese spread with pepper and spread it out on the bread slice.</li>
	<li>Now arrange the thin slices of tomato and cucumber over the cheese.</li>

You can even apply a layer of <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/pudina-chutney/">pudina chutney</a> inside the sandwich to make it more <em>chatpata</em>.

<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
Sometimes the roll wont stay together on its own in which case you can prick it with toothpicks. This also prevents the roll from bulging and breaking when you are cutting out the pinwheel slices.
