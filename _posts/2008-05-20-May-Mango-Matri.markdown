I was ecstatic and was wondered how I can make the most of them. They were placed like a piece of art on my table for a few days. I allowed them to become semi-ripe and made good use of one mango in making these matris.</p><p>Few days ago I saw this recipe on TV where they were making little mango dumplings in a curd gravy. I tweaked the recipe to make these matris (in North India Matri refers to a kind of Biscuit made from a well-seasoned dough of wheat flour. Its usually deep fried and crunchy)</p><p>I tried my hand at this mango matri and was happy with the final taste. I actually baked the matris initially as that way they can be preserved for a few days. Whenever you want to eat them just deep fry in hot oil.</p><p>Please try finding a raw mango thats neither completely raw nor completely ripe. To make these matris a filling breakfast roll out the dough (poori-size) and deep fry. This is my entry to <a href="http://arundati.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/wbb22-announcement-may-mango-madness/">WBB#22, May Mango Madness</a> hosted by <a href="http://arundati.wordpress.com/">Escapades</a>.</p><p><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p><ul><li>1 Semi-raw mango</li><li>3 tablespoons Gram Flour / Besan</li><li>1/2 cup Curds</li><li>1 teaspoon Chilly Powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon Carom Seeds</li><li>Pinch of Kasuri Methi</li></ul><p><strong>Procedure :</strong></p><ol><li>Roast mango directly on the flame.
