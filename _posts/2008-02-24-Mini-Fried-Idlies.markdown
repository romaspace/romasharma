<u><b>Mini Fried Idlies</b></u>

After the age of 8 months babies start eating dosas, idlies, etc; Fried idlies is a good choice at this point as the size is perfect for babies and it takes lesser time to make than idlies. Moreover, adding some vegetables can help make it a nutritious choice for your baby.

For this dish you need to get a stand which resembles a tava with molds in it. This is locally called a <i>Kuzhi Paniyaram </i>stand and can be directly used on flame for making these mini fried idlies.

<b>Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
	<li>3 tablespoons of dosa batter</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon rai</li>
	<li>1/4 carrot, grated</li>
	<li>1/2 tomato, finely chopped</li>
	<li>Few mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<b>Procedure :</b>
<ol>
	<li>Mix a pinch of salt in dosa batter</li>
	<li>Grease the molds with ghee. Add rai and let it crackle.</li>
	<li>Fill batter in each mold.</li>
	<li>Garnish with grated carrot, finely cut tomatoes and mint leaves.</li>
	<li>Fry each idly for about 5 mins. Flip over and continue frying the opposite side.</li>

<u><b>Varitation</b></u>

If this dish is being made for adults :
<ol>
	<li>You can add some more salt, finely chopped onions, green chillies and grated ginger to the dosa batter. Add a tadka of rai, channa dal and curry leaves. Use oil instead of ghee here.</li>
	<li>Please try to use dosa batter thats slightly sour. In other words, you can use up the previous days leftover batter.</li>
	<li>You can use Spring onion leaves instead of mint leaves. Your baby might like this variation too.</li>
</ol>
<b>Please NOTE :</b>
<ol>
	<li> Try to use a non-stick mold as otherwise you will need to pour ghee from the sides after filling batter into the molds.</li>
	<li>My stand's manual told me to use it only on low flame. Please read instructions on your stand before using.</li>
</ol>
