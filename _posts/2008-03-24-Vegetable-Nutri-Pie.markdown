<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Vegetable Nutri Pie</strong></span>

<a title="nutripie_withflower.jpg" href="/2008/03/nutripie_withflower.jpg"><img src="/2008/03/nutripie_withflower.jpg" alt="nutripie_withflower.jpg" /></a>

When I saw the event for making a <a href="http://funnfud.blogspot.com/2008/03/event-announcement-wbb21-balanced.html">Balanced Breakfast</a> I immediately remembered my mother's innovative vegetable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie">pie </a>that she used to make so we would not crave for junk food. Attractive as it looked, we never really imagined that it was meant to be healthy.

In this recipe we use wheat flour, vegetables and bake the dish making it a lot better than other spicy, deep-fried snacks we eat. If you add some sprouts to the vegetable stuffing it becomes even more nutritious. You can try this out on a lazy Sunday morning when you are in no mood to head off anywhere.

Thanks <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/01109414198476017680">Mansi </a>for giving me a reason to try out my mom's treasured recipe.
