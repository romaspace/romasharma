This money bag has been specially made with the vegetable we are celebrating all this month in <a href="http://creativepooja.blogspot.com/2008/05/lets-celebrate-completion-of-2.html">JFI , Bell Peppers</a>!

Bell pepper is amongst the tastiest vegetables I have come across. Typically available in a green color and goes onto being found in other technicolor versions like red, orange and yellow. It can make your dishes really colorful and attractive. Interestingly, all colors of bell peppers taste different. If you ever happen to have all of them try making <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/baked-vegetables/">Baked Vegetables</a> . It will highlight the taste of each of them. Enjoy a different taste in each bite!

My husbands all time favorite capsicum dish is <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/stuffed-capsicum/">Bharwa Shimla Mirch</a>. I usually make this one when I have guests over for dinner (only constraint is that one needs to find the really small capsicums to stuff).

Last Sunday, at the super market I found the freshest button mushrooms I have ever seen. I bought them and began wondering what the best way to use them would be. I thought of experimenting with the Money Bag Savory I really liked in Daily Breads (A leading Bakery Chain in Bangalore). They usually stuff it with mixed vegetables but one can always fill it with veggies of one's choice. I love the taste of capsicums with mushrooms and onions.

I got cracking on these money bags and found them to be very easy to make. They can be deep fried too but I prefer baking them as that way they are lower in calories and many can be made at one shot.
