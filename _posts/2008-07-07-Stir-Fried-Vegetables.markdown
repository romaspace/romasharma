When you call someone home for dinner and have an elaborate menu planned you dont really want to spend too much time on each dish. It helps to have some dishes that are easy to make and definitely taste great. One such dish that comes to mind is <em>Stir fried vegetables</em>.

Capsicums of all colors have a different taste and when combined with corn it results in a new flavor. The natural juice of vegetables used is the reason behind this dish tasting good although it doesnt really have much masala going into it.
This dish belongs to the Indo-Chinese cuisine (main course), the curry paste and paneer giving it the Indian touch. I guess abroad they must make this with Tofu.

I have made this mixed vegetable a couple of times when I have had guests home and it has always been a hit. This is my entry to the <a href="http://culinarybazaar.blogspot.com/2008/06/huan-yin-to-awed-event-with-theme.html">AWED - Chinese event</a> hosted by <a href="http://culinarybazaar.blogspot.com">OK's Culinary Bazaar</a>.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>3 colors of capsicum - red, yellow, green</li>
	<li>1 cup paneer cubes</li>
	<li>1 cup fresh corn</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons curry paste ( a fried paste comprising of onion, ginger, garlic and tomatoes)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon Olive oil</li>
	<li>5-6 Garlic pods</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon tabasco sauce</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Heat oil. Saute garlic till golden brown. Add paneer and stir fry for a few minutes.</li>
	<li>Add diced capsicum and fresh corn.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle salt and stir well. Cook till veggies are soft.</li>
	<li>Now add tabasco sauce, pepper powder and mix well.</li>
	<li>Add curry paste and saute for a few more minutes.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Note :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Curry pastes are readily available in the market making this recipe easy to make. However, if you can not find a pack of curry paste you can fry onions to golden brown, followed by ginger-garlic paste and tomatoes. Fry till this paste leaves fat from the sides.</li>
	<li>Most ready-made curry pastes contain salt. So when you are adding salt to your dish please add accordingly.</li>
</ol>
