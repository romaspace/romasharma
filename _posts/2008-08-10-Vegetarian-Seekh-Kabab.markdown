For a really long time I have been thinking of making these vegetarian kababs which my mom had learnt from her close friend. Its a recipe that requires considerable effort and may be thats why I was putting it off. Finally, when I saw the <a href="http://blog.sigsiv.com/2008/07/monthly-mingle-announcement-grill-it.html">Monthly Mingle - Grill It</a> event being organized by Live to Eat, it motivated me to try my hand at it. These vegetarian kababs are made from black chick peas. Its a long drawn process of soaking, boiling, stir frying, grinding, grilling and then finally toasting. Let me see, have I left out any cooking procedure? :-)
I grilled the kababs in the oven so that the outer crust gets a firm texture. Then I went on to toast it on the flame directly. I must also tell you that the end result tasted like never before. The taste of the carefully and mildly burnt sections of the kabab was so unique that now I might want to make it more often.
These kababs which are a bit dry should preferably be served with a minty, thick curd dip or a cheese dip to add to the moisture content.
