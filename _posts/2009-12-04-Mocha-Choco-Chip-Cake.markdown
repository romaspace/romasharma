The house is filled with the fragrance of roses and fresh rajnigandhas. I had got a whiff of the sweet scent a night before and knew they were there somewhere in the house. I was positive my mom would have brought flowers like she does every anniversary. Then we got a lot more flowers, from friends and family. Our house looks dressed up and now you know the air that the lucky florists breath every day. My 3 -year old baby noticed everyone giving us flowers. She went into the garden, picked a withered rose from our plant and gave it to her papa saying 'Happy Anniversary'.<!--more-->

Mayank followed the ritual of taking me out to dinner to an unknown place. It was the Oberoi at MG Road this time. The ride was pleasant. Especially the moon, was it full yday? Coz it was definitely BIG and made a  wallpaper backdrop through our drive.

<dl class="wp-caption "> </dl>The menu was continental and the baby was pampered with exotic food right through. I had half a mind of exchanging  plates with her! She had a blast, she created an unusual environment in the silence of a grand restaurant where people dont even make the slightest munch while eating their meal. The Baby loved the restroom so she decided to go there every 30 mins. The sweet attender got her a pasta with cheese (non-spicy) made specially for her and she said in these exact words ' I dont want it, keep it on the other table' :-) Mayank and I went red. Next Mayank took her to the loo for the 4th time, she ended up peeing in her frock! First time this happens in months and that too in a fancy place like this. He took off her frock and let her back into the dinner room. My jaw dropped when I saw the baby enter the room in a vest and a diaper! Unfortunately I had only a spare t-shirt and no pant. I examined her frock, it wasnt that wet. So I dry wiped it and put it back on her. No choice. Soon baby was given crisp french fries and a bowl of sauce into which she instantly dipped her fingers. After stuffing her face with french fries she was full, so she  decided to do something different - she tore my new shiny hair band into bits. The pampering continued and she was served with choco marble cakes. She ate half of it and left the remaining ensuring we dont get to eat it either (but I managed to finish it, I am also her mom! :-))

Finally the dinner was over and the pleasant and ohh so sweet waiters came to our table with a bouquet of flowers and a scrumptious chocolate cake. I was about to cut it and the baby pushed from behind. The table being a regular trolley moved ahead. Gosh! The last thing I needed was to have my face in the cake and everyone around me controlling  their laughter! :-)  Thankfully the cake cutting went off well. Mayank caught the baby in time so I managed to cut a thin sliver of the cake which I naturally gave my super enthu baby.

We returned late at night with the baby curled up and fast asleep in the car. Once it was all over it seemed so funny that I just had to pen it down. Baby, when you are grown up and go for your anniversary dinner, please read this post so will  definitely have a hearty laugh before going out to celebrate. I think the day was very special to me. Thanks so all  the people who sent flowers, gifts, best wishes and calls to make our day. The dinner was delicious and the ambiance  was perfect. A very memorable day indeed.

I made a mocha chocolate chip cake for our anniversary. It was a simple cake made in very little time. Thankfully, it came out soft even without much beating. It was a recipe made on the fly. I'm sharing it with you here.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup All purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 cup wheat flour</li>
	<li>1.5 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon coffee powder</li>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon chocolate chips</li>
	<li>1 egg</li>
	<li>1 cup butter</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Shift the dry ingredients. Beat the butter and the egg separately.</li>
	<li>Slowly add the dry mix and the beaten egg alternately to the butter and beat well.</li>
	<li>Add vanilla essence , chocolate chips and mix.</li>
	<li>Bake at 180 Deg C for 30 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please note:</strong>
The cake didnt have a strong coffee smell. In order to increase the taste of coffee you can increase the
coffee powder quantity and sugar as well.
