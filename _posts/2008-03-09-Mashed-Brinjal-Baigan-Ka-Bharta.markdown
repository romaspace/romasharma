<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Variation</strong></span>
<ol>
	<li>You can add 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala also but please be careful as the dish already contains green chillies and should not become too spicy.</li>
	<li>You can burn a small piece of coal over the flame, keep few cloves on it and pour a tablespoon of ghee on it. Place this fuming coal in the middle of the bharta and cover the lid. This will lend an enchanting coal flavor to the bharta. You just have to try this one!</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Original Bharta recipe</strong></span>

For some reason the Original <em>Baigan ka Bharta</em> recipe got tampered with, over time. The influence of methods used to cook other vegetables was probably the reason for this. In olden days the brinjal was burnt over coal, seasoned without any further cooking and consumed.

<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Follow first 3 steps in the procedure mentioned previously. This will give you the burnt brinjal pulp.</li>
	<li>Roast jeera seeds and powder them with the help of a mortar-pestle.</li>
	<li>Take a few teaspoons of mustard oil. Add finely chopped green chillies, onions and roasted jeera powder to it.</li>
	<li>Mix in the burnt brinjal mash and some salt.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE</strong> :

In the original recipe the mustard oil used is not heated. Yes, we are actually mixing in chillies and onions raw! Well, so much for the original recipe.
