<u><b>Paneer fingers</b></u>

Now that the baby is more than a year old everything we make for ourselves can be given to him with the exception of things that are too spicy or oily.

Paneer is a rich, yet easily digestible milk product that you can try out for your baby.

<b>Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
	<li>2 teaspoons of ghee</li>
	<li>Pinch of hing</li>
	<li>Pinch of haldi powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon jeera powder</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon dhania powder</li>
	<li>6 paneer fingers</li>
	<li>Juice of lime</li>
</ul>
<b>Procedure :</b>
<ol>
	<li>Heat ghee. Add hing, haldi powder, jeera powder, dhania powder and stir for a few seconds.</li>
	<li>Add paneer fingers and stir well till the ghee coats the paneer.</li>
	<li>Add a pinch of salt, few drops of lime juice and mix well.</li>
</ol>
<b>Please NOTE :</b>
You can use a sandwich griller to cook the paneer fingers so that it needs lesser ghee to cook.
