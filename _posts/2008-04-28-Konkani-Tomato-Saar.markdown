A month ago my dear friend and neighbour, Namita invited us over for dinner. It was the day of holi and we were tired after the day-long celebrations. We had a colored, water-filled bash in the apartment, after which we went to a couple of places to wish family members. By the end of the day I was glad I was invited for dinner as I didnt have the stamina to cook.

Namita had made an array of tradional Konkani dishes. After a discussion with her I learnt that Konkani food is fairly simple and very nutritious. They dont believe in using too much oil or spices. I noticed that the food had a flavor thats different from the other South-Indian cuisines.

Tomato Saar for instance is one such simple curry which uses the usual South-Indian ingredients like tomatoes, coconut , chillies and curry leaves yet it manages to create a never-before taste. After we returned from her place I tried this Saar out and it was an instant hit at home. Ever since we have made it almost four times and still cant seem to get enough of it.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>4 big ripe tomatoes</li>
	<li>3-4 finger like pieces of coconut</li>
	<li>2 green chillies</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon methi seeds</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon rai</li>
	<li>Few curry leaves</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Boil the tomatoes with green chillies till they are soft. Save the boiled water.</li>
	<li>In a little bit of oil roast the methi seeds to golden color.</li>
	<li>Grind the boiled tomatoes, chillies with methi seeds and coconut in a mixie jar.</li>
	<li>Now in the previously saved boiled water add the ground mixture and give it another boil.</li>
	<li>For the tempering heat oil. Add rai, curry leaves and pour over the saar.</li>
</ol>
