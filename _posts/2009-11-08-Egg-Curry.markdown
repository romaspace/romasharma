What do you do on a day like this? Bangalore saw no sun. Even my 2-year old was asking me what the matter was. Its been gloomy and cloudy like an evening 6 pm through out the day! All cars in the basement were intact. That means no one wants to venture out in the cold. I was in the mood to eat something hot and spicy. Given that you cant go anywhere you got to make it yourself. So thats how I decided to make egg curry with parathas and jeera rice for our Sunday Lunch.<!--more-->

Today was not only a cold day but also a terribly windy one. It was impossible to take any pictures in my terrace. I usually like to shoot in natural light but the wind was blowing harder than ever. I had to use some pillows to hold my backdrops and the chart paper was just swaying in the breeze leaving crinkles everywhere. I felt like the wind was challenging me and finally it would just blow the curry on my face for thinking I was smart enough to get away with a snap or two.

Thankfully I got a picture and the dish turned out well too. My hubby and critic - Mayank liked it, so it has passed the litmus test. Although I am an eggetarian I dont like to eat food that smells of egg. Typical reasons why the smell remains:

1) If the egg was not boiled to completion : yes, this will definitely leave a smell behind. If you accidentally under cooked the eggs while boiling please ensure you cook it enough along with the curry

2) When egg whites are used in any dish - typically as a glaze over bakes, the whites need to be beaten well else the baked product will smell of egg.

Ok, one last tipÂ  (I promise this is the last one). When you make fried egg/omelet/any other form of egg , please ensure that you dont use the same gauze to clean the pan as you use for all the other dishes. You need to wash it directly with your hands or a disposable gauze else all the dishes will smell of egg.
