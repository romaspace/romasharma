I was instantly hooked up by the tag 'Traditional Sindhi Cool Drink'. It caught my attention and didnt let go for several seconds. I logged into Avisha's blog not knowing what to expect. <a href="http://www.simplysindhirecipes.com/2009/05/a-refreshing-sindhi-cold-drink/">There it was</a> - a tall glass with a chilled red beverage in it. I was thirsty the second I saw it. To my delight I realized that I had all the required ingredients - a watermelon, rose syrup (Roohafza - my all time fave) and ice. I thought I'll blend these sometime to check out what the result would taste like. Like all other Sindhi delicacies I was sure this one would be good too.

<!--more-->The Red Glass followed me like a Ghost. I couldn't get it out of my head. So 24 hrs later I found myself standing in front of a mixie jar and ready to take the test. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, baby n Dad were sitting around warming the couch. I quickly made a glass of the traditional Sindhi drink and had a few sips. It is safe to say that the combination was perfect. All three ingredients namely watermelon, Roohafza and ice act as chilling agents to the body and so the overall combination results in a drink thats super cool. Please try it out when you have a watermelon at home next, this recipe gets a thumbs up from me. Thanks so much for sharing <a href="http://www.simplysindhirecipes.com/2009/05/a-refreshing-sindhi-cold-drink/">the recipe</a> Avisha.
