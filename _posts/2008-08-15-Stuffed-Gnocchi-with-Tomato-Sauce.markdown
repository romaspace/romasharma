<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocchi">Gnocch</a>i is a thick dumpling most commonly made from potato. It can be made from other ingredients like semolina, wheat flour, bread crumbs as well. <strong>Gnocco </strong>in Italian means <em>lump</em>.

I came across this recipe by Shreyas Goenka while watching a show on NDTV Good times. I was amazed at seeing such a young boy make Gnocchi and drop-dead gorgeous cakes with such ease.

I've never tried making pasta from scratch. May be I was just too lazy or always had a packet of pasta ready at hand. This recipe sounded interesting as it had some elements that were different from what the usual pasta contains like mashed potatoes and cheese. I did not have basil leaves so I used dry mixed herb powder instead (a combination of basil, rosemary and thyme). Also, I used tomato puree instead of the fresh tomatoes. I was getting restless and hungry but those of you who try your hand at this one please use fresh tomatoes.

One important point that I think was missed out in description of this recipe is that the Gnocchi cubes once cut out need to pushed off the teeth of a fork so they become curled and indented. Just hold your fork out, place a Gnocchi piece on the base end of the teeth and roll the Gnocchi off with mild pressure so that indentations are formed on it. Oil your fork after making 4-5 Gnocchis. I remember Chef Shreyas showing this procedure during the show. He also mentioned that this helps in cooking the Gnocchi uniformly.
