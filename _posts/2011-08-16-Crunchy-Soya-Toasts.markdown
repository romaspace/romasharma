I love Tata Sky- it has made my life<em> jhin ga la la</em>! Simply because we get new recipe videos everyday. These are typically 4 videos recorded for NDTV Good times and some other regional channels earlier. The set of 4 videos is called 'Menu for the day' and it has a starter, a salad/ beverage, a main course dish and a dessert. Some times the combination varies, like if its raining too much outside they have only hot snacks. They even have festival special videos where they demonstrate how to make delicacies specific to each occasion.<!--more-->

Aravind, the younger brother of the house help we had after my delivery is very interested in trying his hand at new dishes. He had come home to stay with us for a couple of days and watched the recipe for crunchy soya toasts on Tata Sky. He didnt realize that the video repeats itself all day. I found it really cute when he said 'Didi, I have understood the recipe, when is it going to stop?' :-)

Few days later he soaked the soya beans on his own and started making these toasts in the evening. It was such a pleasant surprise and I ran for my camera to share it with you guys. I liked the way this little 15-year old was making a unique snack smartly on his own. I watched as he deep fried the toasts and thought to myself 'This guy is like I was years ago' (I wont tell you how many years ago, or you will know my age! ;-p)
