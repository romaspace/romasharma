We keep <a href="/2008/09/ganeshji_ki_sthapna.jpg">Ganeshji Ki Sthapna</a> for about 10 days and submerge the idol on Ekadashi (a day in the Hindi Calender). These 10 days we do pooja everyday. Sometimes when I'm busy I dont find the time to make the prasad in the morning. For such days, I have certain instant sweet mixes which can remain fresh for almost 2 weeks. Whenever I need to make prasad for pooja or if I want to offer laddus to unexpected guests :) I just need to bind the mix and use it.

Some commonly used ingredients for making these kind of powders include rawa, roasted gram flour powder and groundnuts. Any of these can be used following the same procedure described below and can be stored for about 2 weeks in an air tight container without refrigeration. Here, I have used thin beaten rice which is a less commonly used base for laddu mixes. It however tastes good and the poha / beaten rice offers softness to the laddu.
You can bind the powder with hot milk or ghee. Sugar can also be replaced with Jaggery. You can select the dry fruits you wish to add to your laddu mix.

This is my entry to the <a href="http://romaspacenew.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/long-live-the-shelf/">Long Live the Shelf</a> event that I'm hosting this month. This instant poha laddu mix can be stored for 2 weeks in an air tight container without refrigeration.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup thin poha / beaten rice</li>
	<li>1/2 cup dry dessicated coconut powder</li>
	<li>less than 1/2 cup sugar (change as per your taste)</li>
	<li>Few almonds, raisins and cardamoms</li>
	<li>Few teaspoons of hot milk to bind</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Dry roast the beaten rice till its crinkly. Place in a dry mixie jar.</li>
	<li>Dry roast the dry coconut powder for about a minute, stirring continuously. Place along with poha in the mixie jar.</li>
	<li>Now roast almonds and cardamom seeds and add to the other roasted ingredients.</li>
	<li>Once the contents of the mixie jar cool add sugar and grind the contents into a powder.</li>
	<li>Store this powder in an air tight container.</li>
	<li>Whenever you need to prepare laddus just add hot milk / ghee to the powder and bind it.</li>
	<li>Dust the laddus with some more powder and garnish it with a raisin. You can fry raisins in the same ghee you heated for the binding.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Its really easy for the thin poha and the dry coconut powder to get burnt. You need to stir them continuously.</li>
	<li>Please wait till the roasted ingredients completely cool off before adding sugar.</li>
	<li>While binding, add hot milk / ghee in small quantities else you might suddenly find the dough unmanageable.</li>
</ol>
