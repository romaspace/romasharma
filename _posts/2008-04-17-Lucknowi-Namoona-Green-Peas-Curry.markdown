<em>Namoona</em> is a famous peas curry eaten in Lucknow. I had the opportunity of having it last week and I think its one of the tastiest curries one can have with roti.

Green peas are in abundance right now. I bought a few kilos, pealed and froze them. So now anytime I suddenly have guests over this is one vegetable I can surely prepare.

You might need a little extra time and effort as compared to other curries but its worth it when you finally get to eat something so exquisite.
