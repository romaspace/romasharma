Wheat crackers are among the most nutritious biscuits available in market today. Non-fried and high in fibre they make a perfect snack to be had with tea or to kill that hunger in-between meals.

Dress them up and they become an attractive option to be had as a side-dish. Replace your salad with these and watch them disappear from the dinner table. Even kids who usually dont eat salad will have at least one!

<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>

Spinach is extremely nutritious and should be a part of ones regular salad. Whenever you make salad you can place it on lettuce, spinach, etc; to ensure we get our greens in the most nutritious form - raw!

However, please place the crackers over a tissue paper as green leaves can make the crackers soggy.
