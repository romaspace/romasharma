Its just eggless and butterless guys, not tasteless!

This is a soft yet heavy cake which also happens to be quite healthy. I made it mildly sweet soÂ  my baby could enjoy it to her hearts content. You can always make it sweeter if you like. This cake is particularly nutritious thanks to wheat flour, curds and the goodness of milk cream.

Malai or heavy milk cream is always available in every Indian home. Its like a sheet thats picked up from the surface of milk and can be stored in the freezer for long durations. Its usually later processed to make ghee or butter. However, the quantity of malai you get depends on the fat content of the milk. The milk I used when I was abroad never ever gave me cream :-( I guess then you need to buy the cream separately (please be careful to not buy the fresh cream instead!).

Eggless and butterless cakes are quite common these days but have you heard of a cake thats flourless? Yes, there happens to be a flourless cake called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacher_torte">Sacher Torte</a> which is a Viennese delight. It was created by accident and today is one of the most hit chocolate pastries world wide. I have a recipe of this in my book which I am yet to try out. For now, its the eggless, butterless cake.

<strong>Ingredients :</strong>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup wheat flour</li>
	<li>1 cup rawa (fine variety)</li>
	<li>1 cup curd</li>
	<li>1 cup malai (heavy milk cream)</li>
	<li>1 cup ground sugar (add more as per your taste)</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Baking soda</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon Baking powder</li>
	<li>2 cups of milk</li>
	<li>Few walnuts and almonds</li>
</ul>
<strong>Procedure :</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Blend all ingredients (except nuts) in a mixie jar.</li>
	<li>Dust finely chopped walnuts and almonds. Mix into batter.</li>
	<li>Grease and dust a cake mold. Pour batter into the mold.</li>
	<li>Bake at 180 Deg C for 45 mins.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Please NOTE :</strong>

Since the ingredients used are very dense its essential to prick the center of the cake to check if its done. If the toothpick comes out clean then its ready else put it back into the oven for 10 mins.<strong>
