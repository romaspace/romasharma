<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Spring Onion Toasts</strong></span>

Herbs and Spring onions add flavor to this dish which is a cousin of the famous French Toast. Herb powders are readily available in most grocery stores these days. If you dont find them, not to worry. Use your old packet of Pizza seasoning that has been lying in your fridge since your last Pizza Party. Go on, experiment with this yummy breakfast....
